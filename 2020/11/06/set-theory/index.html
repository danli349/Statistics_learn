Explicitly, if the collection of open subsets <span class="math inline">\(\underset{\text{all }\alpha}{\bigcup} G_{\alpha}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, then there are <strong>finitely</strong> many indices <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[K\subset G_{\alpha_1}\cup G_{\alpha_2}\cup\cdots\cup G_{\alpha_n}\]</span><br />

Conversely, suppose <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact relative to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(G_{\alpha}\)</span> be a collection of open subsets of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which covers <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(V_{\alpha}=Y\cap G_{\alpha}\)</span> Then <span class="math display">\[K\subset V_{\alpha_1}\cup\cdots\cup V_{\alpha_n}\]</span> will hold for some choice of finitely many indices <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n\)</span> and since <span class="math inline">\(V_{\alpha}\subset G_{\alpha}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(K\subset G_{\alpha_1}\cup G_{\alpha_2}\cup\cdots\cup G_{\alpha_n}\)</span> and then <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact relative to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span> is closed, <span class="math inline">\(x\in E\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x\notin E^c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span>. Hence there exists a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E^c\cap N\)</span> is empty, that is <span class="math inline">\(N\in E\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is an interior point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is open. Next suppose <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is open, let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span>. Then every neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> contains a point of <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not an interior point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is open, this means that <span class="math inline">\(x\in E^c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span> is closed. The conclusion is a set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is open if and only if its complement is closed or a set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is closed if and only if its complement is open.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be a compact subset of metric space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, suppose <span class="math inline">\(q\in K\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p\in X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\notin K\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(V_q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W_q\)</span> be the neighborhoods of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, respectively, of radius less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}d(p,q)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact there are finitely many points <span class="math inline">\(q_1,\cdots,q_n\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, such that <span class="math display">\[K\subset (W_{q1}\cup\cdots\cup W_{qn})=W\]</span> if <span class="math inline">\(V=V_{q1}\cap\cdots\cap V_{qn}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> which does not intersect with <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(V\subset K^c\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is an interior point of <span class="math inline">\(K^c\)</span>, which means <span class="math inline">\(K^c\)</span> is open and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is closed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Closed subsets of a compact set are compact</strong>. Suppose the closed subset of compact set <span class="math inline">\(F\subset K\subset X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a closed subset relative to compact set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(\{V_{\alpha}\}\)</span> be an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(F^c\)</span> is adjoined to <span class="math inline">\(\{V_{\alpha}\}\)</span>, we obtain an open cover <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact, there is finite sub-collection <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> which covers <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and hence <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(F^c\)</span> is a member of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, we may remove it from <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> and still retain an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Then, a finite sub-collection of <span class="math inline">\(\{V_{\alpha}\}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is compact.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\{K_{\alpha}\}\)</span> is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that the intersection of <strong>every finite sub-collection</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\{K_{\alpha}\}\)</span> is nonempty, fix a member <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\{K_{\alpha}\}\)</span> and denote <span class="math inline">\(G_{\alpha}=K_{\alpha}^c\)</span>. Assume that no point of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> belongs to every <span class="math inline">\(K_{\alpha}\)</span>, then the sets <span class="math inline">\(G_{\alpha}\)</span> form an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> and since <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> is compact, there are finitely many indices <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n\)</span>, such that <span class="math display">\[K_1\subset(G_{\alpha_1}\cup\cdots\cup G_{\alpha_n})\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[K_1\subset(K_{\alpha_1}^c\cup\cdots\cup K_{\alpha_n}^c)\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[K_1\subset(K_{\alpha_1}\cap\cdots\cap K_{\alpha_n})^c\]</span> but this means <span class="math display">\[K_1\cap(K_{\alpha_1}\cap\cdots\cap K_{\alpha_n})\]</span> is empty, which contradicts to our hypothesis. Then there must be some point of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> belongs to every <span class="math inline">\(K_{\alpha}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cap K_{\alpha}\)</span> is nonempty.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an infinite subset of compact set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> must have a limit point in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Because if no point of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, each point <span class="math inline">\(q\in K\)</span> would have a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V_q\)</span> which contains at most one point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (if there are more than one points in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> for every neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> will be a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>). And because <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is infinite, it is clear that no finite sub-collection of <span class="math inline">\(\{V_q\}\)</span> can cover <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and the same is true of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(E\subset K\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> can’t be compact.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Every k-cell is compact</strong>, because let <span class="math inline">\(\delta=\Biggl[\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k}(a_i-b_i)^2\Biggr]^{1/2}\)</span> be the length of the diagonal of this k-cell <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, then for any two points <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf x-\mathbf y|\le\delta\)</span>.

We can divide <span class="math inline">\(I_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span> k-cells again to get <span class="math inline">\(I_2\)</span>, the diagonal of these new cells is <span class="math inline">\(2^{-2}\delta\)</span>, then the diagonal of <span class="math inline">\(I_n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2^{-n}\delta\)</span>. If the radius of open cover <span class="math inline">\(G_{\alpha}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, we can increase <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> large enough that the diagonal of the k-cell <span class="math inline">\(I_n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(2^{-n}\delta&lt;r\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(I_n\subset G_{\alpha}\)</span> which means every k-cell can be covered by some sub-collection of <span class="math inline">\(\{G_{\alpha}\}\)</span> and the number of these sub-collections <span class="math inline">\(\{G_{\alpha}\}\)</span> is finite and no more than <span class="math inline">\(2^{kn}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If a set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(R^k\)</span> is closed and bounded, then <span class="math inline">\(E\subset I\)</span> for some compact k-cell <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the closed subset of compact set <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is also compact</strong>.

Then <span class="math display">\[U=U_{q_1}\cap\cdots\cap U_{q_n}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[W=V_{q_1}\cup\cdots\cup V_{q_n}\]</span> satisfy that <span class="math inline">\(p\in U, K\subset W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\cap W=\varnothing\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> can be every point in <span class="math inline">\(K^c\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(K^c\)</span> must be open and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> must be closed. <strong>Compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\{K_a\}\)</span> is a collection of compact subsets of a Hausdorff space and if <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap_aK_a=\varnothing\)</span>. Fix a member <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\{K_a\}\)</span>, since no point of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> belongs to every other <span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{K_a^c\}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(K_1\subset K_{a_1}^c\cup\cdots\cup K_{a_n}^c\)</span> for some finite collection <span class="math inline">\(\{K_{a_i}^c\}\)</span>. This implies that <span class="math display">\[K_1\cap K_{a_1}\cap\cdots\cap K_{a_n}=\varnothing\]</span> then some finite sub-collection of <span class="math inline">\(\{K_a\}\)</span> also has empty intersection.</p></li>
