<h1>1 The Basics of Bayesian Statistics</h1>
<p>Bayesian statistics mostly involves <strong>conditional probability</strong>, which is the the probability of an event A <strong>given</strong> event B, and it can be calculated using the Bayes rule. The concept of conditional probability is widely used in medical testing, in which false positives and false negatives may occur. A false positive can be defined as a positive outcome on a medical test when the patient does not actually have the disease they are being tested for. In other words, it’s the probability of testing positive given no disease. Similarly, a false negative can be defined as a negative outcome on a medical test when the patient does have the disease. In other words, testing negative given disease. Both indicators are critical for any medical decisions.</p>
<p>For how the Bayes’ rule is applied, we can set up a prior, then calculate posterior probabilities based on a prior and likelihood. That is to say, the prior probabilities are updated through an iterative process of data collection.</p>
<div id="bayes-rule" class="section level2">
<h2>Bayes’ Rule</h2>
<p>This section introduces how the Bayes’ rule is applied to calculating
conditional probability, and several real-life examples are
demonstrated. Finally, we compare the Bayesian and frequentist
definition of probability.</p>
<div id="sec:bayes-rule" class="section level3">
<h3>Conditional Probabilities &amp; Bayes’ Rule</h3>
<p>Consider Table <a href="#tab:2015gallupDating"><strong>??</strong></a>. It shows the results of a
poll among 1,738 adult Americans. This table allows us to calculate
probabilities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>temp &lt;- matrix(c(60, 86, 58, 21, 225, 255, 426, 450, 382, 1513, 315, 512, 508, 403, 1738), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

</table>
<p>For instance, the probability of an adult American using an online
dating site can be calculated as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
    P(\text{using an online dating site}) = \\
    \frac{\text{Number that indicated they used an online dating site}}{\text{Total number of people in the poll}}
    = \frac{225}{1738} \approx 13\%.
\end{multline*}\]</span> This is the overall probability of using an online
dating site. Say, we are now interested in the probability of using an
online dating site if one falls in the age group 30-49. Similar to the
above, we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
    P(\text{using an online dating site} \mid \text{in age group 30-49}) = \\
    \frac{\text{Number in age group 30-49 that indicated they used an online dating site}}{\text{Total number in age group 30-49}}
    = \frac{86}{512} \approx 17\%.
\end{multline*}\]</span>
Here, the pipe symbol `|’ means <strong>conditional on</strong>.
This is a <strong>conditional probability</strong> as one can consider it the
probability of using an online dating site conditional on being in age
group 30-49.</p>
<p>We can rewrite this conditional probability in terms of ‘regular’
probabilities by dividing both numerator and the denominator by the
total number of people in the poll. That is, <span class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
    P(\text{using an online dating site} \mid \text{in age group 30-49}) \\
\begin{split}
    &amp;= \frac{\text{Number in age group 30-49 that indicated they used an online dating site}}{\text{Total number in age group 30-49}} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\frac{\text{Number in age group 30-49 that indicated they used an online dating site}}{\text{Total number of people in the poll}}}{\frac{\text{Total number in age group 30-49}}{\text{Total number of people in the poll}}} \\
    &amp;= \frac{P(\text{using an online dating site \&amp; falling in age group 30-49})}{P(\text{Falling in age group 30-49})}.
\end{split}
\end{multline*}\]</span> It turns out this relationship holds true for any
conditional probability and is known as Bayes’ rule:</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unnamed-chunk-2" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1  (Bayes’ Rule)  </strong></span>The conditional probability of the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> conditional on the event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is given by</p>

Bayes’ rule provides a way to compute this conditional probability:</p>

    &amp;= \frac{\text{Number in age group 18-29 that indicated they used an online dating site}}{\text{Total number in age group 18-29}} = \frac{60}{315} \approx 19\%.

<div id="sec:diagnostic-testing" class="section level3">
<h3>Bayes’ Rule and Diagnostic Testing</h3>
<p>To better understand conditional probabilities and their importance, let
us consider an example involving the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
In the early 1980s, HIV had just been discovered and was rapidly
expanding. There was major concern with the safety of the blood supply.
Also, virtually no cure existed making an HIV diagnosis basically a
death sentence, in addition to the stigma that was attached to the
disease.</p>
<p>These made false positives and false negatives in HIV testing highly
undesirable. A <strong>false positive</strong> is when a test returns postive while
the truth is negative. That would for instance be that someone without
HIV is wrongly diagnosed with HIV, wrongly telling that person they are
going to die and casting the stigma on them. A <strong>false negative</strong> is
when a test returns negative while the truth is positive. That is when
someone with HIV undergoes an HIV test which wrongly comes back
negative. The latter poses a threat to the blood supply if that person
is about to donate blood.</p>
<p>The probability of a false positive if the truth is negative is called
the false positive rate. Similarly, the false negative rate is the
probability of a false negative if the truth is positive. Note that both
these rates are conditional probabilities: The false positive rate of an
HIV test is the probability of a positive result <strong>conditional on</strong> the
person tested having no HIV.</p>
<p>The HIV test we consider is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
commonly known as an ELISA. We would like to know the probability that
someone (in the early 1980s) has HIV if ELISA tests positive. For this,
we need the following information. ELISA’s true positive rate (one minus
the false negative rate), also referred to as sensitivity, recall, or
probability of detection, is estimated as <span class="math display">\[
  P(\text{ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Person tested has HIV}) = 93\% = 0.93.
\]</span> Its true negative rate (one minus the false positive rate), also
referred to as specificity, is estimated as <span class="math display">\[
  P(\text{ELISA is negative} \mid \text{Person tested has no HIV}) = 99\% = 0.99.
\]</span> Also relevant to our question is the prevalence of HIV in the overall
population, which is estimated to be 1.48 out of every 1000 American
adults. We therefore assume <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) = \frac{1.48}{1000} = 0.00148.
  (\#eq:HIVpositive)
\end{equation}\]</span> Note that the above numbers are estimates. For our
purposes, however, we will treat them as if they were exact.</p>
<p>Our goal is to compute the probability of HIV if ELISA is positive, that
is <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{ELISA is positive})\)</span>. In
none of the above numbers did we condition on the outcome of ELISA.
Fortunately, Bayes’ rule allows is to use the above numbers to compute
the probability we seek. Bayes’ rule states that</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:HIVconditional">\[\begin{equation}
  P(\text{Person tested has HIV}  \mid \text{ELISA is positive}) = \frac{P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \,\&amp;\, \text{ELISA is positive})}{P(\text{ELISA is positive})}.
   \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>This can be derived as follows. For someone to test positive and be HIV
positive, that person first needs to be HIV positive and then secondly
test positive. The probability of the first thing happening is
<span class="math inline">\(P(\text{HIV positive}) = 0.00148\)</span>. The probability of then testing
positive is
<span class="math inline">\(P(\text{ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Person tested has HIV}) = 0.93\)</span>,
the true positive rate. This yields for the numerator</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:HIVjoint">\[\begin{multline}
  P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \,\&amp;\, \text{ELISA is positive}) \\
  \begin{split}
  &amp;= P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) P(\text{ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Person tested has HIV}) \\
  &amp;= 0.00148 \cdot 0.93
  = 0.0013764.
  \end{split}
  \tag{2}
\end{multline}\]</span>
<p>The first step in the above equation is implied by Bayes’ rule: By
multiplying the left- and right-hand side of Bayes’ rule as presented in
Section <a href="#sec:bayes-rule"><strong>??</strong></a> by <span class="math inline">\(P(B)\)</span>, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
  P(A \mid B) P(B) = P(A \,\&amp;\, B).
\]</span></p>
<p>The denominator in <a href="#eq:HIVconditional">(1)</a> can be expanded as</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
  P(\text{ELISA is positive}) \\
  \begin{split}
  &amp;= P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \,\&amp;\, \text{ELISA is positive}) + P(\text{Person tested has no HIV} \,\&amp;\, \text{ELISA is positive}) \\
  &amp;= 0.0013764 + 0.0099852 = 0.0113616
  \end{split}
\end{multline*}\]</span>
<p>where we used <a href="#eq:HIVjoint">(2)</a> and</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
  P(\text{Person tested has no HIV} \,\&amp;\, \text{ELISA is positive}) \\
  \begin{split}
  &amp;= P(\text{Person tested has no HIV}) P(\text{ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Person tested has no HIV}) \\
  &amp;= \left(1 - P(\text{Person tested has HIV})\right) \cdot \left(1 - P(\text{ELISA is negative} \mid \text{Person tested has no HIV})\right) \\
  &amp;= \left(1 - 0.00148\right) \cdot \left(1 - 0.99\right) = 0.0099852.
  \end{split}
\end{multline*}\]</span>
<p>Putting this all together and inserting into <a href="#eq:HIVconditional">(1)</a>
reveals
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
P(\\text{Person tested has HIV} \\mid \\text{ELISA is positive}) =
\\frac{0.0013764}{0.0113616} \\approx 0.12.
(\\\#eq:HIVresult)
\\end{equation}
\]</span> So even when the ELISA returns positive, the probability
of having HIV is only 12%. An important reason why this number is so low
is due to the prevalence of HIV. Before testing, one’s probability of
HIV was 0.148%, so the positive test changes that probability
dramatically, but it is still below 50%. That is, it is more likely that
one is HIV negative rather than positive after one positive ELISA test.</p>
<p>Questions like the one we just answered (What is the probability of a
disease if a test returns positive?) are crucial to make medical
diagnoses. As we saw, just the true positive and true negative rates of
a test do not tell the full story, but also a disease’s prevalence plays
a role. Bayes’ rule is a tool to synthesize such numbers into a more
useful probability of having a disease after a test result.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-4" class="example"><strong>Example 2  </strong></span>What is the probability that someone who tests positive does not actually have HIV?
</div>
<p>We found in <a href="#eq:HIVresult">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> that someone who tests positive has a
<span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span> probability of having HIV. That implies that the same person has
a <span class="math inline">\(1-0.12=0.88\)</span> probability of not having HIV, despite testing positive.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-5" class="example"><strong>Example 3  </strong></span>If the individual is at a higher risk for having HIV than a randomly sampled person from the population considered, how, if at all, would you expect <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{ELISA is positive})\)</span> to change?
</div>
<p>If the person has a priori a higher risk for HIV and tests positive,
then the probability of having HIV must be higher than for someone not
at increased risk who also tests positive. Therefore,
<span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{ELISA is positive}) &gt; 0.12\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span> comes from <a href="#eq:HIVresult">(<strong>??</strong>)</a>.</p>
<p>One can derive this mathematically by plugging in a larger number in
<a href="#eq:HIVpositive">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> than 0.00148, as that number represents the prior
risk of HIV. Changing the calculations accordingly shows
<span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{ELISA is positive}) &gt; 0.12\)</span>.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-6" class="example"><strong>Example 4  </strong></span>If the false positive rate of the test is higher than 1%, how, if at all, would you expect <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{ELISA is positive})\)</span> to change?
</div>
<p>If the false positive rate increases, the probability of a wrong
positive result increases. That means that a positive test result is
more likely to be wrong and thus less indicative of HIV. Therefore, the
probability of HIV after a positive ELISA goes down such that
<span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{ELISA is positive}) &lt; 0.12\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="bayes-updating" class="section level3">
<h3>Bayes Updating</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that one positive ELISA test yields a
probability of having HIV of 12%. To obtain a more convincing
probability, one might want to do a second ELISA test after a first one
comes up positive. What is the probability of being HIV positive if also
the second ELISA test comes back positive?</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we will assume that the correctness of this
second test is not influenced by the first ELISA, that is, the tests are
independent from each other. This assumption probably does not hold true
as it is plausible that if the first test was a false positive, it is
more likely that the second one will be one as well. Nonetheless, we
stick with the independence assumption for simplicity.</p>
<p>In the last section, we used
<span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) = 0.00148\)</span>, see <a href="#eq:HIVpositive">(<strong>??</strong>)</a>,
to compute the probability of HIV after one positive test. If we repeat
those steps but now with <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) = 0.12\)</span>, the
probability that a person with one positive test has HIV, we exactly
obtain the probability of HIV after two positive tests. Repeating the
maths from the previous section, involving Bayes’ rule, gives</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:Bayes-updating">\[\begin{multline}
  P(\text{Person tested has HIV} \mid \text{Second ELISA is also positive}) \\
  \begin{split}
  &amp;= \frac{P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) P(\text{Second ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Person tested has HIV})}{P(\text{Second ELISA is also positive})} \\
  &amp;= \frac{0.12 \cdot 0.93}{
  \begin{split}
  &amp;P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) P(\text{Second ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Has HIV}) \\
  &amp;+ P(\text{Person tested has no HIV}) P(\text{Second ELISA is positive} \mid \text{Has no HIV})
  \end{split}
  } \\
  &amp;= \frac{0.1116}{0.12 \cdot 0.93 + (1 - 0.12)\cdot (1 - 0.99)} \approx 0.93.
  \end{split}
  \tag{3}
\end{multline}\]</span>
<p>Since we are considering the same ELISA test, we used the same true
positive and true negative rates as in Section
<a href="#sec:diagnostic-testing"><strong>??</strong></a>. We see that two positive tests makes it
much more probable for someone to have HIV than when only one test comes
up positive.</p>
<p>This process, of using Bayes’ rule to update a probability based on an
event affecting it, is called Bayes’ updating. More generally, the what
one tries to update can be considered ‘prior’ information, sometimes
simply called the <strong>prior</strong>. The event providing information about this
can also be data. Then, updating this prior using Bayes’ rule gives the
information conditional on the data, also known as the <strong>posterior</strong>, as
in the information <strong>after</strong> having seen the data. Going from the prior
to the posterior is Bayes updating.</p>
<p>The probability of HIV after one positive ELISA, 0.12, was the posterior
in the previous section as it was an update of the overall prevalence of
HIV, <a href="#eq:HIVpositive">(<strong>??</strong>)</a>. However, in this section we answered a
question where we used this posterior information as the prior. This
process of using a posterior as prior in a new problem is natural in the
Bayesian framework of updating knowledge based on the data.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-7" class="example"><strong>Example 5  </strong></span>What is the probability that one actually has HIV after testing positive 3 times on the ELISA? Again, assume that all three ELISAs are independent.
</div>
<p>Analogous to what we did in this section, we can use Bayes’ updating for
this. However, now the prior is the probability of HIV after two
positive ELISAs, that is <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Person tested has HIV}) = 0.93\)</span>.

<h3>Bayesian vs. Frequentist Definitions of Probability</h3>
<p>The frequentist definition of probability is based on observation of a
large number of trials. The probability for an event <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to occur is
<span class="math inline">\(P(E)\)</span>, and assume we get <span class="math inline">\(n_E\)</span> successes out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials. Then we
have <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
P(E) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{n_E}{n}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Bayesian definition of probability <span class="math inline">\(P(E)\)</span>
reflects our prior beliefs, so <span class="math inline">\(P(E)\)</span> can be any probability
distribution, provided that it is consistent with all of our beliefs.
(For example, we cannot believe that the probability of a coin landing
heads is 0.7 and that the probability of getting tails is 0.8, because
they are inconsistent.)</p>
<p>The two definitions result in different methods of inference. Using the
frequentist approach, we describe the confidence level as the proportion
of random samples from the same population that produced confidence
intervals which contain the true population parameter. For example, if
we generated 100 random samples from the population, and 95 of the
samples contain the true parameter, then the confidence level is 95%.
Note that each sample either contains the true parameter or does not, so
the confidence level is NOT the probability that a given interval
includes the true population parameter.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-8" class="example"><strong>Example 6  </strong></span>Based on a 2015 Pew Research poll on 1,500 adults: "We are 95% confident that 60% to 64% of Americans think the federal government does not do enough for middle class people.
</div>
<p>The correct interpretation is: 95% of random samples of 1,500 adults
will produce confidence intervals that contain the true proportion of
Americans who think the federal government does not do enough for middle
class people.</p>
<p>Here are two common misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a 95% chance that this confidence interval includes the
true population proportion.</p></li>
<li><p>The true population proportion is in this interval 95% of the time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The probability that a given confidence interval captures the true
parameter is either zero or one. To a frequentist, the problem is that
one never knows whether a specific interval contains the true value with
probability zero or one. So a frequentist says that “95% of similarly
constructed intervals contain the true value”.</p>
<p>The second (incorrect) statement sounds like the true proportion is a
value that moves around that is sometimes in the given interval and
sometimes not in it. Actually the true proportion is constant, it’s the
various intervals constructed based on new samples that are different.</p>
<p>The Bayesian alternative is the credible interval, which has a
definition that is easier to interpret. Since a Bayesian is allowed to
express uncertainty in terms of probability, a Bayesian credible
interval is a range for which the Bayesian thinks that the probability
of including the true value is, say, 0.95. Thus a Bayesian can say that
there is a 95% chance that the credible interval contains the true
parameter value.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-9" class="example"><strong>Example 7  </strong></span>The posterior distribution yields a 95% credible interval of 60% to 64% for the proportion of Americans who think the federal government does not do enough for middle class people.
</div>
<p>We can say that there is a 95% probability that the proportion is
between 60% and 64% because this is a <strong>credible</strong> interval, and more
details will be introduced later in the course.
## Inference for a Proportion</p>

<div id="inference-for-a-proportion-frequentist-approach" class="section level3">
<h3>Inference for a Proportion: Frequentist Approach</h3>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:RU-486" class="example"><strong>Example 8  </strong></span>RU-486 is claimed to be an effective “morning after” contraceptive pill, but is it really effective?</p>
<p>Data: A total of 40 women came to a health clinic asking for emergency contraception (usually to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex). They were randomly assigned to RU-486 (treatment) or standard therapy (control), 20 in each group. In the treatment group, 4 out of 20 became pregnant. In the control group, the pregnancy rate is 16 out of 20.</p>
Question: How strongly do these data indicate that the treatment is more effective than the control?
</div>
<p>To simplify the framework, let’s make it a one proportion problem and just consider the 20 total pregnancies because the two groups have the same sample size. If the treatment and control are equally effective, then the probability that a pregnancy comes from the treatment group (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) should be 0.5. If RU-486 is more effective, then the probability that a pregnancy comes from the treatment group (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) should be less than 0.5.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can form the hypotheses as below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p =\)</span> probability that a given pregnancy comes from the treatment group</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = 0.5\)</span> (no difference, a pregnancy is equally likely to come from the treatment or control group)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_A: p &lt; 0.5\)</span> (treatment is more effective, a pregnancy is less likely to come from the treatment group)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A p-value is needed to make an inference decision with the frequentist approach. The definition of p-value is the probability of observing something <strong>at least</strong> as extreme as the data, given that the null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is true. “More extreme” means in the direction of the alternative hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>).</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> states that the probability of success (pregnancy) is 0.5, we can calculate the p-value from 20 independent Bernoulli trials where the probability of success is 0.5. The outcome of this experiment is 4 successes in 20 trials, so the goal is to obtain 4 or fewer successes in the 20 Bernoulli trials.</p>
<p>This probability can be calculated exactly from a binomial distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span> trials and success probability <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>. Assume <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the actual number of successes observed, the p-value is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(k \leq 4) = P(k = 0) + P(k = 1) + P(k = 2) + P(k = 3) + P(k = 4)\]</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(dbinom(0:4, size = 20, p = 0.5))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.005908966</code></pre>
<p>According to <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{R}\)</span>, the probability of getting 4 or fewer successes in 20 trials is 0.0059. Therefore, given that pregnancy is equally likely in the two groups, we get the chance of observing 4 or fewer preganancy in the treatment group is 0.0059. With such a small probability, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the data provide convincing evidence for the treatment being more effective than the control.</p>
</div>
<div id="inference-for-a-proportion-bayesian-approach" class="section level3">
<h3>Inference for a Proportion: Bayesian Approach</h3>
<p>This section uses the same example, but this time we make the inference for the proportion from a Bayesian approach. Recall that we still consider only the 20 total pregnancies, 4 of which come from the treatment group. The question we would like to answer is that how likely is for 4 pregnancies to occur in the treatment group. Also remember that if the treatment and control are equally effective, and the sample sizes for the two groups are the same, then the probability (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) that the pregnancy comes from the treatment group is 0.5.</p>
<p>Within the Bayesian framework, we need to make some assumptions on the models which generated the data. First, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a probability, so it can take on any value between 0 and 1. However, let’s simplify by using discrete cases – assume <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the chance of a pregnancy comes from the treatment group, can take on nine values, from 10%, 20%, 30%, up to 90%. For example, <span class="math inline">\(p = 20\%\)</span> means that among 10 pregnancies, it is expected that 2 of them will occur in the treatment group. Note that we consider all nine models, compared with the frequentist paradigm that whe consider only one model.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:RU-486prior">2</a> specifies the prior probabilities that we want to assign to our assumption. There is no unique correct prior, but any prior probability should reflect our beliefs prior to the experiement. The prior probabilities should incorporate the information from all relevant research before we perform the current experiement.</p>

<p>This prior incorporates two beliefs: the probability of <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.5\)</span> is highest, and the benefit of the treatment is symmetric. The second belief means that the treatment is equally likely to be better or worse than the standard treatment. Now it is natural to ask how I came up with this prior, and the specification will be discussed in detail later in the course.</p>
<p>Next, let’s calculate the likelihood – the probability of observed data for each model considered. In mathematical terms, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\text{data}|\text{model}) = P(k = 4 | n = 20, p)\]</span></p>
<p>The likelihood can be computed as a binomial with 4 successes and 20 trials with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is equal to the assumed value in each model. The values are listed in Table <a href="#tab:RU-486prior">2</a>.</p>
<p>After setting up the prior and computing the likelihood, we are ready to calculate the posterior using the Bayes’ rule, that is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{model}|\text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{model})P(\text{data}|\text{model})}{P(\text{data})}\]</span></p>
<p>The posterior probability values are also listed in Table <a href="#tab:RU-486prior">2</a>, and the highest probability occurs at <span class="math inline">\(p=0.2\)</span>, which is 42.48%. Note that the priors and posteriors across all models both sum to 1.</p>
<p>In decision making, we choose the model with the highest posterior probability, which is <span class="math inline">\(p=0.2\)</span>. In comparison, the highest prior probability is at <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> with 52%, and the posterior probability of <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> drops to 7.8%. This demonstrates how we update our beliefs based on observed data. Note that the calculation of posterior, likelihood, and prior is unrelated to the frequentist concept (data “at least as extreme as observed”).</p>
<p>Here are the histograms of the prior, the likelihood, and the posterior probabilities:</p>

<p>We started with the high prior at <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>, but the data likelihood peaks at <span class="math inline">\(p=0.2\)</span>. And we updated our prior based on observed data to find the posterior. The Bayesian paradigm, unlike the frequentist approach, allows us to make direct probability statements about our models. For example, we can calculate the probability that RU-486, the treatment, is more effective than the control as the sum of the posteriors of the models where <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.5\)</span>. Adding up the relevant posterior probabilities in Table <a href="#tab:RU-486prior">2</a>, we get the chance that the treatment is more effective than the control is 92.16%.</p>

<h3>Effect of Sample Size on the Posterior</h3>
<p>The RU-486 example is summarized in Figure <a href="#fig:RU-486plot">1</a>, and let’s look at what the posterior distribution would look like if we had more data.</p>

</div>
<p>Suppose our sample size was 40 instead of 20, and the number of successes was 8 instead of 4. Note that the ratio between the sample size and the number of successes is still 20%. We will start with the same prior distribution. Then calculate the likelihood of the data which is also centered at 0.20, but is less variable than the original likelihood we had with the smaller sample size. And finally put these two together to obtain the posterior distribution. The posterior also has a peak at p is equal to 0.20, but the peak is taller, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:RU-486plotX2">2</a>. In other words, there is more mass on that model, and less on the others.</p>

</div>
<p>To illustrate the effect of the sample size even further, we are going to keep increasing our sample size, but still maintain the the 20% ratio between the sample size and the number of successes. So let’s consider a sample with 200 observations and 40 successes. Once again, we are going to use the same prior and the likelihood is again centered at 20% and almost all of the probability mass in the posterior is at p is equal to 0.20. The other models do not have zero probability mass, but they’re posterior probabilities are very close to zero.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:RU-486plotX10">3</a> demonstrates that <strong>as more data are collected, the likelihood ends up dominating the prior</strong>. This is why, while a good prior helps, a bad prior can be overcome with a large sample. However, it’s important to note that this will only work as long as we do not place a zero probability mass on any of the models in the prior.
## Frequentist vs. Bayesian Inference</p>
</div>
<div id="frequentist-vs.-bayesian-inference" class="section level3">
<h3>Frequentist vs. Bayesian Inference</h3>
<p>In this section, we will solve a simple inference problem using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Then we will compare our results based on decisions based on the two methods, to see whether we get the same answer or not. If we do not, we will discuss why that happens.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:MM" class="example"><strong>Example 9  </strong></span>We have a population of M&amp;M’s, and in this population the percentage of yellow M&amp;M’s is either 10% or 20%. You have been hired as a statistical consultant to decide whether the true percentage of yellow M&amp;M’s is 10% or 20%.</p>
<p>Payoffs/losses: You are being asked to make a decision, and there are associated payoff/losses that you should consider. If you make the correct decision, your boss gives you a bonus. On the other hand, if you make the wrong decision, you lose your job.</p>
<p>Data: You can “buy” a random sample from the population – You pay $200 for each M&amp;M, and you must buy in $1,000 increments (5 M&amp;Ms at a time). You have a total of $4,000 to spend, i.e., you may buy 5, 10, 15, or 20 M&amp;Ms.</p>
Remark: Remember that the cost of making a wrong decision is high, so you want to be fairly confident of your decision. At the same time, though, data collection is also costly, so you don’t want to pay for a sample larger than you need. If you believe that you could actually make a correct decision using a smaller sample size, you might choose to do so and save money and resources.
</div>
<p>Let’s start with the frequentist inference.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hypothesis: <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is 10% yellow M&amp;Ms, and <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> is &gt;10% yellow M&amp;Ms.</p></li>
<li><p>Significance level: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>One sample: red, green, <strong>yellow</strong>, blue, orange</p></li>
<li><p>Observed data: <span class="math inline">\(k=1, n=5\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>P-value: <span class="math inline">\(P(k \geq 1 | n=5, p=0.10) = 1 - P(k=0 | n=5, p=0.10) = 1 - 0.90^5 \approx 0.41\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the p-value is the probability of observed or more extreme outcome given that the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Therefore, we fail to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and conclude that the data do not provide convincing evidence that the proportion of yellow M&amp;M’s is greater than 10%. This means that if we had to pick between 10% and 20% for the proportion of M&amp;M’s, even though this hypothesis testing procedure does not actually confirm the null hypothesis, we would likely stick with 10% since we couldn’t find evidence that the proportion of yellow M&amp;M’s is greater than 10%.</p>
<p>The Bayesian inference works differently as below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hypotheses: <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is 10% yellow M&amp;Ms, and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> is 20% yellow M&amp;Ms.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior: <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1) = P(H_2) = 0.5\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Sample: red, green, <strong>yellow</strong>, blue, orange</p></li>
<li><p>Observed data: <span class="math inline">\(k=1, n=5\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Likelihood:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(k=1 | H_1) &amp;= \left( \begin{array}{c} 5 \\ 1 \end{array} \right) \times 0.10 \times 0.90^4 \approx 0.33 \\
P(k=1 | H_2) &amp;= \left( \begin{array}{c} 5 \\ 1 \end{array} \right) \times 0.20 \times 0.80^4 \approx 0.41
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Posterior</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(H_1 | k=1) &amp;= \frac{P(H_1)P(k=1 | H_1)}{P(k=1)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.33}{0.5 \times 0.33 + 0.5 \times 0.41} \approx 0.45 \\
P(H_2 | k=1) &amp;= 1 - 0.45 = 0.55
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The posterior probabilities of whether <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> is correct are close to each other. As a result, with equal priors and a low sample size, it is difficult to make a decision with a strong confidence, given the observed data. However, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> has a higher posterior probability than <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, so if we had to make a decision at this point, we should pick <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, i.e., the proportion of yellow M&amp;Ms is 20%. Note that this decision contradicts with the decision based on the frequentist approach.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:freq-vs-bayes">3</a> summarizes what the results would look like if we had chosen larger sample sizes. Under each of these scenarios, the frequentist method yields a higher p-value than our significance level, so we would fail to reject the null hypothesis with any of these samples. On the other hand, the Bayesian method always yields a higher posterior for the second model where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is equal to 0.20. So the decisions that we would make are contradictory to each other.</p>

<p>However, if we had set up our framework differently in the frequentist method and set our null hypothesis to be <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.20\)</span> and our alternative to be <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.20\)</span>, we would obtain different results. This shows that <strong>the frequentist method is highly sensitive to the null hypothesis</strong>, while in the Bayesian method, our results would be the same regardless of which order we evaluate our models.</p>

<h1>2 Bayesian Inference</h1>
<p>This chapter is focused on the continuous version of Bayes’ rule and how to use it in a conjugate family. The RU-486 example will allow us to discuss Bayesian modeling in a concrete way. It also leads naturally to a Bayesian analysis without conjugacy. For the non-conjugate case, there is usually no simple mathematical expression, and one must resort to computation. Finally, we discuss credible intervals, i.e., the Bayesian analog of frequentist confidence intervals, and Bayesian estimation and prediction.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the readers have mastered the concept of conditional probability and the Bayes’ rule for discrete random variables. Calculus is not required for this chapter; however, for those who do, we shall briefly look at an integral.</p>

<h2>Continuous Variables and Eliciting Probability Distributions</h2>
<p>We are going to introduce continuous variables and how to elicit probability distributions, from a prior belief to a posterior distribution using the Bayesian framework.</p>
<div id="from-the-discrete-to-the-continuous" class="section level3">
<h3>From the Discrete to the Continuous</h3>
<p>This section leads the reader from the discrete random variable to continuous random variables. Let’s start with the binomial random variable such as the number of heads in ten coin tosses, can only take a discrete number of values: 0, 1, 2, up to 10.</p>
<p>When the probability of a coin landing heads is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the chance of getting <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> heads in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> tosses is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X = k) = \left( \begin{array}{c} n \\ k \end{array} \right) p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\]</span>.</p>
<p>This formula is called the <strong>probability mass function</strong> (pmf) for the binomial.</p>
<p>The probability mass function can be visualized as a histogram in Figure <a href="#fig:histogram">4</a>. The area under the histogram is one, and the area of each bar is the probability of seeing a binomial random variable, whose value is equal to the x-value at the center of the bars base.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggthemes)
data = data.frame(trials = c(0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3))

</div>
<p>In contrast, the normal distribution, a.k.a. Gaussian distribution or the bell-shaped curve, can take any numerical value in <span class="math inline">\((-\infty,+\infty)\)</span>. A random variable generated from a normal distribution because it can take a continuum of values.</p>
<p>In general, if the set of possible values a random variable can take are separated points, it is a discrete random variable. But if it can take any value in some (possibly infinite) interval, then it is a continuous random variable.</p>
<p>When the random variable is <strong>discrete</strong>, it has a <strong>probability mass function</strong> or pmf. That pmf tells us the probability that the random variable takes each of the possible values. But when the random variable is continuous, it has probability zero of taking any single value. (Hence probability zero does not equal to impossible, an event of probabilty zero can still happen.)</p>
<p>We can only talk about the probability of a continuous random variable lined within some interval. For example, suppose that heights are approximately normally distributed. The probability of finding someone who is exactly 6 feet and 0.0000 inches tall (for an infinite number of 0s after the decimal point) is 0. But we can easily calculate the probability of finding someone who is between 5’11" inches tall and 6’1" inches tall.</p>
<p>A <strong>continuous</strong> random variable has a <strong>probability density function</strong> or pdf, instead of probability mass functions. The probability of finding someone whose height lies between 5’11" (71 inches) and 6’1" (73 inches) is the area under the pdf curve for height between those two values, as shown in the blue area of Figure <a href="#fig:pdf-auc">5</a>.<!--^[Code reference: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/probability.html]--></p>

<p>For example, a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> (i.e., variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>) is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2],\]</span></p>

<p>Recall that a probability mass function assigns the probability that a random variable takes a specific value for the discrete set of possible values. The sum of those probabilities over all possible values must equal one.</p>
<p>Similarly, a probability density function is any <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> that is non-negative and has area one underneath its curve.

<div id="elicitation" class="section level3">
<h3>Elicitation</h3>
<p>Next, we introduce the concept of prior elicitation in Bayesian statistics. Often, one has a belief about the distribution of one’s data. You may think that your data come from a binomial distribution and in that case you typically know the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number of trials but you usually do not know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the probability of success. Or you may think that your data come from a normal distribution. But you do not know the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> or the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of the normal. Beside to knowing the distribution of one’s data, you may also have beliefs about the unknown <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the binomial or the unknown mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> in the normal.</p>
<p>Bayesians express their belief in terms of personal probabilities. These personal probabilities encapsulate everything a Bayesian knows or believes about the problem. But these beliefs must obey the laws of probability, and be consistent with everything else the Bayesian knows.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:200percent" class="example"><strong>Example 10  </strong></span>You cannot say that your probability of passing this course is 200%, no matter how confident you are. A probability value must be between zero and one. (If you still think you have a probability of 200% to pass the course, you are definitely not going to pass it.)
</div>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:binomial-data" class="example"><strong>Example 11  </strong></span>You may know nothing at all about the value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that generated some binomial data. In which case any value between zero and one is equally likely, you may want to make an inference on the proportion of people who would buy a new band of toothpaste. If you have industry experience, you may have a strong belief about the value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, but if you are new to the industry you would do nothing about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. In any value between zero and one seems equally like a deal. This major personal probability is the uniform distribution whose probably density function is flat, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\text{Unif}(0,1)\)</span>.
</div>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:coin-toss" class="example"><strong>Example 12  </strong></span>If you were tossing a coin, most people believed that the probability of heads is pretty close to half. They know that some coins are biased and that some coins may have two heads or two tails. And they probably also know that coins are not perfectly balanced. Nonetheless, before they start to collect data by tossing the coin and counting the number of heads their belief is that values of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> near 0.5 are very likely, whereas values of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> near 0 or 1 are very unlikely.
</div>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:marriage" class="example"><strong>Example 13  </strong></span>In real life, here are two ways to elicit a probability that you cousin will get married. A frequentist might go to the U.S. Census records and determine what proportion of people get married (or, better, what proportion of people of your cousin’s ethnicity, education level, religion, and age cohort are married). In contrast, a Bayesian might think “My cousin is brilliant, attractive, and fun. The probability that my cousin gets married is really high – probably around 0.97.”
</div>
<p>So a Bayesian will seek to express their belief about the value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> through a probability distribution, and a very flexible family of distributions for this purpose is the <strong>beta family</strong>. A member of the beta family is specified by two parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>; we denote this as <span class="math inline">\(p \sim \text{beta}(\alpha, \beta)\)</span>. The probability density function is
<span class="math display" id="eq:beta">\[
\begin{equation}
f(p) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} p^{\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\beta-1},
\tag{4}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq p \leq 1, \alpha&gt;0, \beta&gt;0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a factorial:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Gamma(n) = (n-1)! = (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 1\]</span></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\beta=1\)</span>, the beta distribution becomes a uniform distribution, i.e. the probabilty density function is a flat line. In other words, the uniform distribution is a special case of the beta family.</p>
<p>The expected value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> can be regarded as the prior number of successes, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> the prior number of failures. When <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\beta\)</span>, then one gets a symmetrical pdf around 0.5. For large but equal values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, the area under the beta probability density near 0.5 is very large. Figure <a href="#fig:beta">6</a> compares the beta distribution with different parameter values.</p>

<p>These kinds of priors are probably appropriate if you want to infer the probability of getting heads in a coin toss. The beta family also includes skewed densities, which is appropriate if you think that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the probability of success in ths binomial trial is close to zero or one.</p>
<p>Bayes’ rule is a machine to turn one’s prior beliefs into posterior beliefs. With binomial data you start with whatever beliefs you may have about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then you observe data in the form of the number of head, say 20 tosses of a coin with 15 heads.</p>
<p>Next, Bayes’ rule tells you how the data changes your opinion about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The same principle applies to all other inferences. You start with your prior probability distribution over some parameter, then you use data to update that distribution to become the posterior distribution that expresses your new belief.</p>
<p>These rules ensure that the change in distributions from prior to posterior is the uniquely rational solution. So, as long as you begin with the prior distribution that reflects your true opinion, you can hardly go wrong.</p>
<p>However, expressing that prior can be difficult. There are proofs and methods whereby a rational and coherent thinker can self-illicit their true prior distribution, but these are impractical and people are rarely rational and coherent.</p>
<p>The good news is that with the few simple conditions no matter what part distribution you choose. If enough data are observed, you will converge to an accurate posterior distribution. So, two bayesians, say the reference Thomas Bayes and the agnostic Ajay Good can start with different priors but, observe the same data. As the amount of data increases, they will converge to the same posterior distribution.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the key ideas in this section:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Bayesians express their uncertainty through probability distributions.</p></li>
<li><p>One can think about the situation and self-elicit a probability distribution that approximately reflects his/her personal probability.</p></li>

<div id="conjugacy" class="section level3">
<h3>Conjugacy</h3>
<p>Next, let’s introduce the concept of conjugacy in Bayesian statistics.</p>
<p>Suppose we have the prior beliefs about the data as below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Binomial distribution <span class="math inline">\(\text{Bin}(n,p)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> known and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> unknown</p></li>
<li><p>Prior belief about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\text{beta}(\alpha,\beta)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we observe <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> success in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials, and it turns out the Bayes’ rule implies that our new belief about the probability density of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is also the beta distribution, but with different parameters. In mathematical terms,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:beta-binomial">\[\begin{equation}
p|x \sim \text{beta}(\alpha+x, \beta+n-x).
\tag{5}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This is an example of conjugacy. Conjugacy occurs when the <strong>posterior distribution</strong> is in the <strong>same family</strong> of probability density functions as the prior belief, but with <strong>new parameter values</strong>, which have been updated to reflect what we have learned from the data.</p>
<p>Why are the beta binomial families conjugate? Here is a mathematical explanation.</p>
<p>Recall the discrete form of the Bayes’ rule:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum^n_{j=1}P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}\]</span></p>
<p>However, this formula does not apply to continuous random variables, such as the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> which follows a beta distribution, because the denominator sums over all possible values (must be finitely many) of the random variable.</p>
<p>But the good news is that the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> has a finite range – it can take any value <strong>only</strong> between 0 and 1. Hence we can perform integration, which is a generalization of the summation. The Bayes’ rule can also be written in continuous form as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi^*(p|x) = \frac{P(x|p)\pi(p)}{\int^1_0 P(x|p)\pi(p) dp}.\]</span></p>
<p>This is analogus to the discrete form, since the integral in the denominator will also be equal to some constant, just like a summation. This constant ensures that the total area under the curve, i.e. the posterior density function, equals 1.</p>
<p>Note that in the numerator, the first term, <span class="math inline">\(P(x|p)\)</span>, is the data likelihood – the probability of observing the data given a specific value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The second term, <span class="math inline">\(\pi(p)\)</span>, is the probability density function that reflects the prior belief about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the beta-binomial case, we have <span class="math inline">\(P(x|p)=\text{Bin}(n,p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi(p)=\text{beta}(\alpha,\beta)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging in these distributions, we get</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^* = \alpha + x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^* = \beta+n-x\)</span>, and we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi^*(p|x) = \text{beta}(\alpha^*,\beta^*) = \text{beta}(\alpha+x, \beta+n-x),\]</span></p>
<p>same as the posterior formula in Equation <a href="#eq:beta-binomial">(5)</a>.</p>
<p>We can recognize the posterior distribution from the numerator <span class="math inline">\(p^{\alpha+x-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1-p)^{\beta+n-x-1}\)</span>. Everything else are just constants, and they must take the unique value, which is needed to ensure that the area under the curve between 0 and 1 equals 1. So they have to take the values of the beta, which has parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha+x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta+n-x\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a cute trick. We can find the answer without doing the integral simply by looking at the form of the numerator.</p>
<p>Without conjugacy, one has to do the integral. Often, the integral is impossible to evaluate. That obstacle is the primary reason that most statistical theory in the 20th century was not Bayesian. The situation did not change until modern computing allowed researchers to compute integrals numerically.</p>
<p>In summary, some pairs of distributions are conjugate. If your prior is in one and your data comes from the other, then your posterior is in the same family as the prior, but with new parameters. We explored this in the context of the beta-binomial conjugate families. And we saw that conjugacy meant that we could apply the continuous version of Bayes’ rule without having to do any integration.
## Three Conjugate Families</p>
<p>In this section, the three conjugate families are beta-binomial, gamma-Poisson, and normal-normal pairs. Each of them has its own applications in everyday life.</p>
</div>
<div id="inference-on-a-binomial-proportion" class="section level3">
<h3>Inference on a Binomial Proportion</h3>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:RU-486more" class="example"><strong>Example 14  </strong></span>Recall Example <a href="#exm:RU-486">8</a>, a simplified version of a real clinical trial taken in Scotland. It concerned RU-486, a morning after pill that was being studied to determine whether it was effective at preventing unwanted pregnancies. It had 800 women, each of whom had intercourse no more than 72 hours before reporting to a family planning clinic to seek contraception.</p>
Half of these women were randomly assigned to the standard contraceptive, a large dose of estrogen and progesterone. And half of the women were assigned RU-486. Among the RU-486 group, there were no pregnancies. Among those receiving the standard therapy, four became pregnant.
</div>
<p>Statistically, one can model these data as coming from a binomial distribution. Imagine a coin with two sides. One side is labeled standard therapy and the other is labeled RU-486. The coin was tossed four times, and each time it landed with the standard therapy side face up.</p>
<p>A frequentist would analyze the problem as below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the probability of a preganancy comes from the standard treatment.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_0: p \geq 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_A: p &lt; 0.5\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The p-value is <span class="math inline">\(0.5^4 = 0.0625 &gt; 0.05\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the frequentist fails to reject the null hypothesis, and will not conclude that RU-486 is superior to standard therapy.</p>
<p>Remark: The significance probability, or p-value, is the chance of observing
data that are as or more supportive of the alternative hypothesis than
the data that were collected, when the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Now suppose a Bayesian performed the analysis. She may set her beliefs about the drug and decide that she has no prior knowledge about the efficacy of RU-486 at all. This would be reasonable if, for example, it were the first clinical trial of the drug. In that case, she would be using the uniform distribution on the interval from 0 to 1, which corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(\text{beta}(1,1)\)</span> density. In mathematical terms,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p \sim \text{Unif}(0,1) = \text{beta}(1,1).\]</span></p>
<p>From conjugacy, we know that since there were four failures for RU-486 and no successes, that her posterior probability of an RU-486 child is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p|x \sim \text{beta}(1+0,1+4) = \text{beta}(1,5).\]</span></p>
<p>This is a beta that has much more area near <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> equal to 0. The mean of <span class="math inline">\(\text{beta}(\alpha,\beta)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\)</span>. So this Bayesian now believes that the unknown <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the probability of an RU-468 child, is about 1 over 6.</p>
<p>The standard deviation of a beta distribution with parameters in alpha and beta also has a closed form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p \sim \text{beta}(\alpha,\beta) \Rightarrow \text{Standard deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2(\alpha+\beta+1)}}\]</span></p>
<p>Before she saw the data, the Bayesian’s uncertainty expressed by her standard deviation was 0.71. After seeing the data, it was much reduced – her posterior standard deviation is just 0.13.</p>
<p>We promised not to do much calculus, so I hope you will trust me to tell you that this Bayesian now believes that her posterior probability that <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.5\)</span> is 0.96875. She thought there was a 50-50 chance that RU-486 is better. But now she thinks there is about a 97% chance that RU-486 is better.</p>
<p>Suppose a fifth child were born, also to a mother who received standard chip therapy. Now the Bayesian’s prior is beta(1, 5) and the additional data point further updates her to a new posterior beta of 1 and 6. <strong>As data comes in, the Bayesian’s previous posterior becomes her new prior, so learning is self-consistent.</strong></p>
<p>This example has taught us several things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We saw how to build a statistical model for an applied problem.</p></li>
<li><p>We could compare the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to inference and see large differences in the conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>We saw how the data changed the Bayesian’s opinion with a new mean for p and less uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>We learned that Bayesian’s continually update as new data arrive. <strong>Yesterday’s posterior is today’s prior.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="the-gamma-poisson-conjugate-families" class="section level3">
<h3>The Gamma-Poisson Conjugate Families</h3>
<p>A second important case is the gamma-Poisson conjugate families. In this case the data come from a Poisson distribution, and the prior and posterior are both gamma distributions.</p>
<p>The Poisson random variable can take any <strong>non-negative integer value</strong> all the way up to infinity. It is used in describing <strong>count data</strong>, where one counts the number of independent events that occur in a fixed amount of time, a fixed area, or a fixed volume.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Poisson distribution has been used to describe the number of phone calls one receives in an hour. Or, the number of pediatric cancer cases in the city, for example, to see if pollution has elevated the cancer rate above that of in previous years or for similar cities. It is also used in medical screening for diseases, such as HIV, where one can count the number of T-cells in the tissue sample.</p>
<p>The Poisson distribution has a single parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, and it is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(X \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;0\)</span>. The probability mass function is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} e^{-\lambda} \text{ for } k=0,1,\cdots,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k! = k \times (k-1) \times \cdots \times 1\)</span>. This gives the probability of observing a random variable equal to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is both the mean and the variance of the Poisson random variable. It is obvious that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> must be greater than zero, because it represents the mean number of counts, and the variance should be greater than zero (except for constants, which have zero variance).</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:Poisson" class="example"><strong>Example 15  </strong></span>Famously, von Bortkiewicz used the Poisson distribution to study the number of Prussian cavalrymen who were kicked to death by a horse each year. This is count data over the course of a year, and the events are probably independent, so the Poisson model makes sense.</p>
<p>He had data on 15 cavalry units for the 20 years between 1875 and 1894, inclusive. The total number of cavalrymen who died by horse kick was 200.</p>
One can imagine that a Prussian general might want to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. The average number per year, per unit. Perhaps in order to see whether some educational campaign about best practices for equine safety would make a difference.
</div>
<p>Suppose the Prussian general is a Bayesian. Introspective elicitation leads him to think that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=0.75\)</span> and standard deviation 1.</p>
<p>Modern computing was unavailable at that time yet, so the Prussian general will need to express his prior as a member of a family conjugate to the Poisson. It turns out that this family consists of the gamma distributions. Gamma distributions describe continuous non-negative random variables. As we know, the value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> in the Poisson can take any non-negative value so this fits.</p>
<p>The gamma family is flexible, and Figure <a href="#fig:gamma">7</a> illustrates a wide range of gamma shapes.</p>

Figure 7: Gamma family
</p>
</div>
<p>The probability density function for the gamma is indexed by shape <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and scale <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\text{Gamma}(k,\theta)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(k,\theta &gt; 0\)</span>. The mathematical form of the density is
<span class="math display" id="eq:gamma">\[
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \dfrac{1}{\Gamma(k)\theta^k} x^{k-1} e^{-x/\theta}
\tag{6}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:gamma-function">\[\begin{equation}
\Gamma(z) = \int^{\infty}_0 x^{z-1} e^{-x} dx.
\tag{7}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(z)\)</span>, the gamma function, is simply a constant that ensures the area under curve between 0 and 1 sums to 1, just like in the beta probability distribution case of Equation <a href="#eq:beta">(4)</a>. A special case is that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer.</p>
<p>However, some books parameterize the gamma distribution in a slightly different way with shape <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = k\)</span> and rate (inverse scale) <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1/\theta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}\]</span></p>
<p>For this example, we use the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> parameterization, but you should always check which parameterization is being used. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{R}\)</span> uses the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> parameterization by default.<br />
In the the later material we find that using the rate parameterization is more convenient.</p>
<p>For our parameterization, the mean of <span class="math inline">\(\text{Gamma}(k,\theta)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(k\theta\)</span>, and the variance is <span class="math inline">\(k\theta^2\)</span>. We can get the general’s prior as below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Mean} &amp;= k\theta = 0.75 \\
\text{Standard deviation} &amp;= \theta\sqrt{k} = 1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Hence
<span class="math display">\[k = \frac{9}{16} \text{ and } \theta = \frac{4}{3}\]</span></p>
<p>For the gamma Poisson conjugate family, suppose we observed data <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\)</span> that follow a Poisson distribution.Then similar to the previous section, we would recognize the kernel of the gamma when using the gamma-Poisson family. The posterior <span class="math inline">\(\text{Gamma}(k^*, \theta^*)\)</span> has parameters</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k^* = k + \sum^n_{i=1} x_i \text{ and } \theta^* = \frac{\theta}{(n\theta+1)}.\]</span></p>
<p>For this dataset, <span class="math inline">\(N = 15 \times 20 = 300\)</span> observations, and the number of casualities is 200. Therefore, the general now thinks that the average number of Prussian cavalry officers who die at the hoofs of their horses follows a gamma distribution with the parameters below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
k^* &amp;= k + \sum^n_{i=1} x_i = \frac{9}{16} + 200 = 200.5625 \\
\theta^* = \frac{\theta}{(n\theta+1)} &amp;= \frac{4/3}{300\times(4/3)} = 0.0033
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>How the general has changed his mind is described in Table <a href="#tab:before-after">4</a>. After seeing the data, his uncertainty about lambda, expressed as a standard deviation, shrunk from 1 to 0.047.</p>

<p>In summary, we learned about the Poisson and gamma distributions; we also knew that the gamma-Poisson families are conjugate. Moreover, we learned the updating fomula, and applied it to a classical dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec:normal-normal" class="section level3">
<h3>The Normal-Normal Conjugate Families</h3>
<p>There are other conjugate families, and one is the normal-normal pair. If your data come from a normal distribution with known variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> but unknown mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, and if your prior on the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, has a normal distribution with self-elicited mean <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and self-elicited variance <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>, then your posterior density for the mean, after seeing a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, is also normal. In mathematical notation, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
x|\mu &amp;\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \\
\mu &amp;\sim N(\nu, \tau^2)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>As a practical matter, one often does not know <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, the standard deviation of the normal from which the data come. In that case, you could use a more advanced conjugate family that we will describe in <a href="#sec:normal-gamma"><strong>??</strong></a>. But there are cases in which it is reasonable to treat the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> as known.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:chemist" class="example"><strong>Example 16  </strong></span>An analytical chemist whose balance produces measurements that are normally distributed with mean equal to the true mass of the sample and standard deviation that has been estimated by the manufacturer balance and confirmed against calibration standards provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p>Note that this normal-normal assumption made by the anayltical chemist is technically wrong, but still reasonable.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The normal family puts some probability on all possible values between <span class="math inline">\((-\infty,+\infty)\)</span>. But the mass on the balance can <strong>never</strong> be negative. However, the normal prior on the unknown mass is usually so concentrated on positive values that the normal distribution is still a good approximation.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the chemist has repeatedly calibrated her balance with standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, she still will not know its standard deviation precisely. However, if she has done it often and well, it is probably a sufficiently good approximation to assume that the standard deviation is known.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>For the normal-normal conjugate families, assume the prior on the unknown mean follows a normal distribution, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\mu \sim N(\nu, \tau^2)\)</span>. We also assume that the data <span class="math inline">\(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\)</span> are independent and come from a normal with variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is also normal, with mean as a weighted average of the prior mean and the sample mean. We have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu|x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n \sim N(\nu^*, \tau^{*2}),\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\nu^* = \frac{\nu\sigma^2 + n\bar{x}\tau^2}{\sigma^2 + n\tau^2} \text{ and } \tau^* = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\tau^2}{\sigma^2 + n\tau^2}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s continue from Example <a href="#exm:chemist">16</a>, and suppose she wants to measure the mass of a sample of ammonium nitrate.</p>
<p>Her balance has a known standard deviation of 0.2 milligrams. By looking at the sample, she thinks this mass is about 10 milligrams and based on her previous experience in estimating masses, her guess has the standard deviation of 2. So she decides that her prior for the mass of the sample is a normal distribution with mean, 10 milligrams, and standard deviation, 2 milligrams.</p>
<p>Now she collects five measurements on the sample and finds that the average of those is 10.5. By conjugacy of the normal-normal family, our posterior belief about the mass of the sample has the normal distribution.</p>
<p>The new mean of that posterior normal is found by plugging into the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mu &amp;\sim N(\nu=10, \tau^2=2^2) \\
\nu^*  &amp;= \frac{\nu\sigma^2 + n\bar{x}\tau^2}{\sigma^2 + n\tau^2} = \frac{10\times(0.2)^2+5\times10.5\times2^2}{(0.2)^2+5\times2^2} = 10.499\\
\tau^* &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\tau^2}{\sigma^2 + n\tau^2}} = \sqrt{(0.2)^2\times2^2}{(0.2)^2+5\times2^2} = 0.089.
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Before seeing the data, the Bayesian analytical chemist thinks the ammonium nitrate has mass 10 mg and uncertainty (standard deviation) 2 mg. After seeing the data, she thinks the mass is 10.499 mg and standard deviation 0.089 mg. Her posterior mean has shifted quite a bit and her uncertainty has dropped by a lot. That’s exactly what an analytical chemist wants.</p>
<p>This is the last of the three examples of conjugate families. There are many more, but they do not suffice for every situation one might have.</p>
<p>We learned several things in this lecture. First, we learned the new pair of conjugate families and the relevant updating formula. Also, we worked a realistic example problem that can arise in practical situations.
## Credible Intervals and Predictive Inference</p>
<p>In this part, we are going to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter by credible intervals after incorporating the data. Then we can use predictive inference to identify the posterior distribution for a new random variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-conjugate-priors" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-Conjugate Priors</h3>
<p>In many applications, a Bayesian may not be able to use a conjugate prior. Sometimes she may want to use a reference prior, which injects the minimum amount of personal belief into the analysis. But most often, a Bayesian will have a personal belief about the problem that cannot be expressed in terms of a convenient conjugate prior.</p>
<p>For example, we shall reconsider the RU-486 case from earlier in which four children were born to standard therapy mothers. But no children were born to RU-486 mothers. This time, the Bayesian believes that the probability p of an RU-486 baby is uniformly distributed between 0 and one-half, but has a point mass of 0.5 at one-half. That is, she believes there is a 50% chance that no difference exists between standard therapy and RU-486. But if a difference exists, she thinks that RU-486 is better, but she is completely unsure about how much better it would be.</p>
<p>In mathematical notation, the probability density function of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi(p) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; \text{for} &amp; 0 \leq p &lt; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; \text{for} &amp; p = 0.5 \\
0 &amp; \text{for} &amp; p &lt; 0 \text{ or } p &gt; 0.5
\end{array}\right.\]</span></p>
<p>We can check that the area under the density curve, plus the amount of the point mass, equals 1.</p>
<p>The cumulative distribution function, <span class="math inline">\(P(p\leq x)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span>, is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(p \leq x) = F(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
0 &amp; \text{for} &amp; x &lt; 0 \\
x &amp; \text{for} &amp; 0 \leq x &lt; 0.5  \\
1 &amp; \text{for} &amp; x \geq 0.5
\end{array}\right.\]</span></p>
<p>Why would this be a reasonable prior for an analyst to self-elicit? One reason is that in clinical trials, there is actually quite a lot of preceding research on the efficacy of the drug. This research might be based on animal studies or knowledge of the chemical activity of the molecule. So the Bayesian might feel sure that there is no possibility that RU-486 is worse than the standard treatment. And her interest is on whether the therapies are equivalent and if not, how much better RU-486 is than the standard therapy.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(\pi^*(p)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> has a complex mathematical form. That is why Bayesian inference languished for so many decades until computational power enabled numerical solutions. But now we have simulation tools to help us, and one of them is called <strong>JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)</strong>.</p>
<p>If we apply JAGS to the RU-486 data with this non-conjugate prior, we can find the posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(\pi^*(p)\)</span>, as in Figure <a href="#fig:JAGS-screenshot"><strong>??</strong></a>. At a high level, this program is defining the binomial probability, that is the likelihood of seeing 0 RU-486 children, which is binomial. And then it defines the prior by using a few tricks to draw from either a uniform on the interval from 0 to one-half, or else draw from the point mass at one-half. Then it calls the JAGS model function, and draws 5,000 times from the posterior and creates a histogram of the results.</p>

<p>The posterior distribution is decreasing when <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is between 0 and 0.5, and has a point mass of probability at 0.5. But now the point mass has less weights than before. Also, note that the data have changed the posterior away from the original uniform prior when <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is between 0 and 0.5. The analyst sees a lot of probability under the curve near 0, which responds to the fact that no children were born to RU-486 mothers.</p>
<p>This section is mostly a look-ahead to future material. We have seen that a Bayesian might reasonably employ a non-conjugate prior in a practical application. But then she will need to employ some kind of numerical computation to approximate the posterior distribution. Additionally, we have used a computational tool, JAGS, to approximate the posterior for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and identified its three important elements, the probability of the data given <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, that is the likelihood, and the prior, and the call to the Gibbs sampler.</p>

<div id="credible-intervals" class="section level3">
<h3>Credible Intervals</h3>
<p>In this section, we introduce credible intervals, the Bayesian alternative to confidence intervals. Let’s start with the confidence intervals, which are the frequentist way to express uncertainty about an estimate of a population mean, a population proportion or some other parameter.</p>
<p>A confidence interval has the form of an upper and lower bound.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L, U = \text{pe} \pm \text{se} \times \text{cv}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> are the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval respectively, <span class="math inline">\(\text{pe}\)</span> represents “point estimates”, <span class="math inline">\(\text{se}\)</span> is the standard error, and <span class="math inline">\(\text{cv}\)</span> is the critical value.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval on the mean is that <strong>“95% of similarly constructed intervals will contain the true mean”</strong>, not “the probability that true mean lies between <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is 0.95”.</p>
<p>The reason for this frequentist wording is that a frequentist may not express his uncertainty as a probability. The true mean is either within the interval or not, so the probability is zero or one. The problem is that the frequentist does not know which is the case.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bayesians have no such qualms. It is fine for us to say that <strong>“the probability that the true mean is contained within a given interval is 0.95”</strong>. To distinguish our intervals from confidence intervals, we call them <strong>credible intervals</strong>.</p>
<p>Recall the RU-486 example. When the analyst used the beta-binomial family, she took the prior as <span class="math inline">\(p \sim \text{beta}(1,1)\)</span>, the uniform distribution, where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the probability of a child having a mother who received RU-486.</p>
<p>After we observed four children born to mothers who received conventional therapy, her posterior is <span class="math inline">\(p|x \sim \text{beta}(1,5)\)</span>. In Figure <a href="#fig:posterior">9</a>, the posterior probability density for <span class="math inline">\(\text{beta}(1,5)\)</span> puts a lot of probability near zero and very little probability near one.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggthemes)
library(ggplot2)
x.vector = seq(from=0, to=1, by=0.001)
y.vector = dbeta(x.vector,1,5)

qplot(x = x.vector, y = y.vector, geom = &quot;line&quot;,  main=&quot;Beta(1,5)&quot;, xlab=&quot;p&quot;, ylab=&quot;Probability Density f(p)&quot;) + theme_tufte()</code></pre>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>For the Bayesian, her 95% credible interval is just any <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> such that the posterior probability that <span class="math inline">\(L &lt; p &lt; U\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(0.95\)</span>. The shortest such interval is obviously preferable.</p>
<p>To find this interval, the Bayesian looks at the area under the <span class="math inline">\(\text{beta}(1,5)\)</span> distribution, that lies to the left of a value x.</p>
<p>The density function of the <span class="math inline">\(\text{beta}(1,5)\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[f(p) = 5 (1-p)^4 \text{ for } 0 \leq p \leq 1,\]</span></p>
<p>and the cumulative distribution function, which represents the area under the density function <span class="math inline">\(f(p)\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[P(p\leq x)= F(x) = \int_0^x f(p)\, dp = 1 - (1-x)^5 ~\text{ for } 0 \leq p \leq 1.\]</span></p>
<p>The Bayesian can use this to find <span class="math inline">\(L, U\)</span> with area 0.95 under the density curve between them, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(F(U) - F(L) = 0.95\)</span>. Note that the Bayesian credible interval is asymmetric, unlike the symmetric confidence intervals that frequentists often obtain. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(L = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U = 0.45\)</span> is the shortest interval with probability 0.95 of containing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>What have we done? We have seen the difference in interpretations between the frequentist confidence interval and the Bayesian credible interval. Also, we have seen the general form of a credible interval. Finally, we have done a practical example constructing a 95% credible interval for the RU-486 data set.</p>
</div>
<div id="predictive-inference" class="section level3">
<h3>Predictive Inference</h3>
<p>Predictive inference arises when the goal is not to find a posterior distribution over some parameter, but rather to find a posterior distribution over some random variable depends on the parameter.</p>
<p>Specifically, we want to make an inference on a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with probability densifity function <span class="math inline">\(f(x|\theta)\)</span>, where you have some personal or prior probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta)\)</span> for the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>
<p>To solve this, one needs to integrate:
<span class="math display">\[P(X \leq x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} P(X \leq x | \theta)\, p(\theta)d\theta = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(\int_{-\infty}^x f(s|\theta)\, ds\right)p(\theta)\, d\theta\]</span></p>
<p>The equation gives us the weighted average of the probabilities for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, where the weights correspond to the personal probability on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Here we will not perform the integral case; instead, we will illustrate the thinking with a discrete example.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-11" class="example"><strong>Example 17  </strong></span>Suppose you have two coins. One coin has probability 0.7 of coming up heads, and the other has probability 0.4 of coming up heads. You are playing a gambling game with a friend, and you draw one of those two coins at random from a bag.</p>
<p>Before you start the game, your prior belief is that the probability of choosing the 0.7 coin is 0.5. This is reasonable, because both coins were equally likely to be drawn. In this game, you win if the coin comes up heads.</p>
Suppose the game starts, you have tossed twice, and have obtained two heads. Then what is your new belief about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the probability that you are using the 0.7 coin?
</div>
<p>This is just a simple application of the discrete form of Bayes’ rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior: <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span></li>
<li>Posterior:
<span class="math display">\[p^* = \frac{P(\text{2 heads}|0.7) \times 0.5}{P(\text{2 heads}|0.7) \times 0.5 + P(\text{2 heads}|0.4) \times 0.5} = 0.754.\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does not answer the important question – What is the predictive probability that the next toss will come up heads? This is of interest because you are gambling on getting heads.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the predictive probability of getting heads is not difficult to calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p^* \text{ of 0.7 coin } = 0.754\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p^* \text{ of 0.4 coin } = 1 − 0.754 = 0.246\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(\text{heads}) = P(\text{heads} | 0.7) \times 0.754 + P(\text{heads} | 0.4) \times 0.246 = 0.626\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the predictive probability that the next toss will come up heads is 0.626.</p>
<p>Note that most realistic predictive inference problems are more complicated and require one to use integrals. For example, one might want to know the chance that a fifth child born in the RU-486 clinical trial will have a mother who received RU-486. Or you might want to know the probability that your stock broker’s next recommendation will be profitable.</p>
<p>We have learned three things in this section. First, often the real goal is <strong>a prediction about the value of a future random variable</strong>, rather than making an estimate of a parameter. Second, these are deep waters, and often one needs to integrate. Finally, in certain simple cases where the parameter can only take discrete values, one can find a solution without integration. In our example, the parameter could only take two values to indicate which of the two coins was being used.</p>

<div id="losses-and-decision-making" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Losses and Decision Making</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we learned about continuous random variables. That enabled us to study conjugate families, such as the beta binomial, the Poisson gamma, and the normal normal. We also considered the difficulties of eliciting a personal prior, and of handling inference in nonconjugate cases. Finally, we introduced the credible interval and studied predictive inference.</p>
<p>In this new chapter, we will introduce loss functions and Bayesian decision making, minimizing expected loss for hypothesis testing, and define posterior probabilities of hypothesis and Bayes factors. We will then outline Bayesian testing for two proportions and two means, discuss how findings from credible intervals compare to those from our hypothesis test, and finally discuss when to reject, accept, or wait.</p>
<div id="bayesian-decision-making" class="section level2">
<h2>Bayesian Decision Making</h2>
<p>To a Bayesian, the posterior distribution is the basis of any inference, since it integrates both his/her prior opinions and knowledge and the new information provided by the data. It also contains everything she believes about the distribution of the unknown parameter of interest.</p>
<p>However, the posterior distribution on its own is not always sufficient. Sometimes the inference we want to express is a <strong>credible interval</strong>, because it indicates a range of likely values for the parameter. That would be helpful if you wanted to say that you are <strong>95% certain</strong> the probability of an RU-486 pregnancy lies between some number <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and some number <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. And on other occasions, one needs to make a single number guess about the value of the parameter. For example, you might want to declare the average payoff for an insurance claim or tell a patient how much longer he/she has to live.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Bayesian perspective leads directly to <strong>decision theory</strong>. And in decision theory, one seeks to minimize one’s expected loss.
## Loss Functions</p>
<p>Quantifying the loss can be tricky, and Table <a href="#tab:loss-functions">5</a> summarizes three different examples with three different loss functions.</p>
<p>If you’re declaring the average payoff for an insurance claim, and if you are <strong>linear</strong> in how you value money, that is, twice as much money is exactly twice as good, then one can prove that the optimal one-number estimate is the <strong>median</strong> of the posterior distribution. But in different situations, other measures of loss may apply.</p>
<p>If you are advising a patient on his/her life expectancy, it is easy to imagine that large errors are far more problematic than small ones. And perhaps the loss increases as the <strong>square</strong> of how far off your single number estimate is from the truth. For example, if she is told that her average life expectancy is two years, and it is actually ten, then her estate planning will be catastrophically bad, and she will die in poverty. In the case when the loss is proportional to the <strong>quadratic</strong> error, one can show that the optimal one-number estimate is the <strong>mean</strong> of the posterior distribution.</p>
<p>Finally, in some cases, the penalty is 0 if you are exactly correct, but constant if you’re at all wrong. This is the case with the old saying that close only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades; i.e., coming close but not succeeding is not good enough. And it would apply if you want a prize for correctly guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar. Here, of course, instead of minimizing expected losses, we want to <strong>maximize the expected gain</strong>. If a Bayesian is in such a situation, then his/her best one-number estimate is the <strong>mode</strong> of his/her posterior distribution, which is the most likely value.</p>
<p>There is a large literature on decision theory, and it is directly linked to risk analysis, which arises in many fields. Although it is possible for frequentists to employ a certain kind of decision theory, it is much more natural for Bayesians.</p>

<p>When making point estimates of unknown parameters, we should make the choices that minimize the loss. Nevertheless, the best estimate depends on the kind of loss function we are using, and we will discuss in more depth how these best estimates are determined in the next section.
## Working with Loss Functions</p>
<p>Now we illustrate why certain estimates minimize certain loss functions.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:car" class="example"><strong>Example 18  </strong></span>You work at a car dealership. Your boss wants to know how many cars the dealership will sell per month. An analyst who has worked with past data from your company provided you a distribution that shows the probability of number of cars the dealership will sell per month. In Bayesian lingo, this is called the posterior distribution. A dot plot of that posterior is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:posterior-decision">10</a>. The mean, median and the mode of the distribution are also marked on the plot. Your boss does not know any Bayesian statistics though, so he/she wants you to report <strong>a single number</strong> for the number of cars the dealership will sell per month.

<p>Suppose your single guess is 30, and we call this <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in the following calculations. If your loss function is <span class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> (i.e., a 0/1 loss), then you lose a point for each value in your posterior that differs from your guess and do not lose any points for values that exactly equal your guess. The total loss is the sum of the losses from each value in the posterior.</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, we define <span class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> (0/1 loss) as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_{0,i}(0,g) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; \text{if } g=x_i \\ 1 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.\]</span></p>
<p>The total loss is <span class="math inline">\(L_0 = \sum_i L_{0,i}(0,g)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s calculate what the total loss would be if your guess is 30. Table <a href="#tab:L0-table">6</a> summarizes the values in the posterior distribution sorted in descending order.</p>
<p>The first value is 4, which is not equal to your guess of 30, so the loss for that value is 1. The second value is 19, also not equal to your guess of 30, and the loss for that value is also 1. The third value is 20, also not equal to your guess of 30, and the loss for this value is also 1.</p>
<p>There is only one 30 in your posterior, and the loss for this value is 0 – since it’s equal to your guess (good news!). The remaining values in the posterior are all different than 30 hence, the loss for them are all ones as well.</p>
<p>To find the total loss, we simply sum over these individual losses in the posterior distribution with 51 observations where only one of them equals our guess and the remainder are different. Hence, the total loss is 50.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:L0-mode">11</a> is a visualization of the posterior distribution, along with the 0-1 loss calculated for a series of possible guesses within the range of the posterior distribution. To create this visualization of the loss function, we went through the process we described earlier for a guess of 30 for all guesses considered, and we recorded the total loss. We can see that the loss function has the lowest value when <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, our guess, is equal to <strong>the most frequent observation</strong> in the posterior. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> is minimized at the <strong>mode</strong> of the posterior, which means that if we use the 0/1 loss, the best point estimate is the mode of the posterior.</p>

<p>Let’s consider another loss function. If your loss function is <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> (i.e., linear loss), then the total loss for a guess is the sum of the <strong>absolute values</strong> of the difference between that guess and each value in the posterior. Note that the absolute value function is required, because overestimates and underestimates do not cancel out.</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> (linear loss) is calculated as <span class="math inline">\(L_1(g) = \sum_i |x_i - g|\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can once again calculate the total loss under <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> if your guess is 30. Table <a href="#tab:L1-table">7</a> summarizes the values in the posterior distribution sorted in descending order.</p>
<p>The first value is 4, and the absolute value of the difference between 4 and 30 is 26. The second value is 19, and the absolute value of the difference between 19 and 30 is 11. The third value is 20 and the absolute value of the difference between 20 and 30 is 10.</p>
<p>There is only one 30 in your posterior, and the loss for this value is 0 since it is equal to your guess. The remaining value in the posterior are all different than 30 hence their losses are different than 0.</p>
<p>To find the total loss, we again simply sum over these individual losses, and the total is to 346.</p>
<p>Again, Figure <a href="#fig:L1-median">12</a> is a visualization of the posterior distribution, along with a linear loss function calculated for a series of possible guesses within the range of the posterior distribution. To create this visualization of the loss function, we went through the same process we described earlier for all of the guesses considered. This time, the function has the lowest value when <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is equal to the <strong>median</strong> of the posterior. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is minimized at the <strong>median</strong> of the posterior one other loss function.</p>

<p>If your loss function is <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> (i.e. a squared loss), then the total loss for a guess is the sum of the squared differences between that guess and each value in the posterior.</p>
<p>We can once again calculate the total loss under <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> if your guess is 30. Table <a href="#tab:L2-table">8</a> summarizes the posterior distribution again, sorted in ascending order.</p>
<p>The first value is 4, and the squared difference between 4 and 30 is 676. The second value is 19, and the square of the difference between 19 and 30 is 121. The third value is 20, and the square difference between 20 and 30 is 100.</p>
<p>There is only one 30 in your posterior, and the loss for this value is 0 since it is equal to your guess. The remaining values in the posterior are again all different than 30, hence their losses are all different than 0.</p>

<p>To sum up, the point estimate to report to your boss about the number of cars the dealership will sell per month <strong>depends on your loss function</strong>. In any case, you will choose to report the estimate that minimizes the loss.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> is minimized at the <strong>mode</strong> of the posterior distribution.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is minimized at the <strong>median</strong> of the posterior distribution.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> is minimized at the <strong>mean</strong> of the posterior distribution.
## Minimizing Expected Loss for Hypothesis Testing</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bayesian statistics, the inference about a parameter is made based on the posterior distribution, and let’s include this in the hypothesis test setting.</p>
<p>Suppose we have two competing hypothesis, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>. Then we get</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \text{ is true } | \text{ data})\)</span> = posterior probability of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(H_2 \text{ is true } | \text{ data})\)</span> = posterior probability of <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>One straightforward way of choosing between <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> would be to <strong>choose the one with the higher posterior probability</strong>. In other words, the potential decision criterion is to</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1 \text{ is true } | \text{ data}) &lt; P(H_2 \text{ is true } | \text{ data})\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, since hypothesis testing is a decision problem, we should also consider a loss function. Let’s revisit the HIV testing example in Section <a href="#sec:diagnostic-testing"><strong>??</strong></a>, and suppose we want to test the two competing hypotheses below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>: Patient does not have HIV</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>: Patient has HIV</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the only two possibilities, so they are mutually exclusive hypotheses that cover the entire decision space.</p>
<p>We can define the loss function as <span class="math inline">\(L(d)\)</span> – the loss that occurs when decision <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is made. Then the Bayesian testing procedure minimizes the posterior expected loss.</p>
<p>The possible decisions (actions) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>: Choose <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> - decide that the patient does not have HIV</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span>: Choose <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> - decide that the patient has HIV</li>
</ul>
<p>For each decision <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, we might be right, or we might be wrong. If the decision is right, the loss <span class="math inline">\(L(d)\)</span> associated with the decision <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is zero, i.e. no loss. If the decision is wrong, the loss <span class="math inline">\(L(d)\)</span> associated with the decision <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is some positive value <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(d=d_1\)</span>, we have</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Right</strong>: Decide patient does not have HIV, and indeed they do not. <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow L(d_1) = 0\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong</strong>: Decide patient does not have HIV, but they do. <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow L(d_1) = w_1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(d=d_2\)</span>, we also have</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Right</strong>: Decide patient has HIV, and indeed they do. <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow L(d_2) = 0\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong</strong>: Decide patient has HIV, but they don’t <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow L(d_2) = w_2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The consequences of making a wrong decision <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span> are different.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> is a <strong>false negative</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We decide that patient does not have HIV when in reality they do.</li>
<li>Potential consequences: no treatment and premature death! (severe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong <span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span> is a <strong>false positive</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We decide that the patient has HIV when in reality they do not.</li>
<li>Potential consequences: distress and unnecessary further investigation. (not ideal but less severe than the consequences of a false negative decision)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s put these definitions in the context of the HIV testing example with ELISA.</p>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>: Patient does not have HIV</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>: Patient has HIV</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>: Choose <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> - decide that the patient does not have HIV</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span>: Choose <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> - decide that the patient has HIV</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Losses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(L(d_1) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; \text{if $d_1$ is right}\\ w_1=1000 &amp; \text{if $d_1$ is wrong} \end{array}\right.\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(L(d_2) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; \text{if $d_2$ is right}\\ w_2=10 &amp; \text{if $d_2$ is wrong} \end{array}\right.\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The values of <span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> are arbitrarily chosen. But the important thing is that <span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span>, the loss associated with a false negative determination, is much higher than <span class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span>, the loss associated with a false positive determination.</p>
<p><strong>Posteriors</strong></p>
<p>The plus sign means that our patient had tested positive on the ELISA.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(H_1|+) \approx 0.88\)</span> - the posterior probability of the patient <strong>not</strong> having HIV given positive ELISA result</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(H_2|+) \approx 0.12\)</span> - the posterior probability of the patient having HIV given positive ELISA result, as the complement value of <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1|+)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected losses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E[L(d_1)] = 0.88 \times 0 + 0.12 \times 1000 = 120\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E[L(d_2)] = 0.88 \times 10 + 0.12 \times 0 = 8.8\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the expected loss for <span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span> is lower, we should make this decision – the patient has HIV.</p>
<p>Note that our decision is highly influenced by the losses we assigned to <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the losses were symmetric, say <span class="math inline">\(w_1 = w_2 = 10\)</span>, then the expected loss for <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> becomes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E[L(d_1)] = 0.88 \times 0 + 0.12 \times 10 = 1.2,\]</span></p>
<p>while the expected loss for <span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span> would not change. Therefore, we would choose <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> instead; that is, we would decide that the patient does not have HIV.</p>
<p>To recap, Bayesian methodologies allow for the integration of losses into the decision making framework easily. And in Bayesian testing, we minimize the posterior expected loss.</p>

<div id="sec:bayes-factors" class="section level2">
<h2>Posterior Probabilities of Hypotheses and Bayes Factors</h2>
<p>In this section, we will continue with the HIV testing example to introduce the concept of Bayes factors. Earlier, we introduced the concept of priors and posteriors. The <strong>prior odds</strong> is defined as <strong>the ratio of the prior probabilities of hypotheses</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore, if there are two competing hypotheses being considered, then the prior odds of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> can be defined as <span class="math inline">\(O[H_1:H_2]\)</span>, which is equal to <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1)\)</span> over probability of <span class="math inline">\(P(H_2)\)</span>. In mathematical terms,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[O[H_1:H_2] = \frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_2)}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>posterior odds</strong> is <strong>the ratio of the two posterior probabilities of hypotheses</strong>, written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[PO[H_1:H_2] = \frac{P(H_1|\text{data})}{P(H_2|\text{data})}\]</span></p>
<p>Using Bayes’ rule, we can rewrite the posterior probabilities as below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
PO[H_1:H_2] &amp;= \frac{P(H_1|\text{data})}{P(H_2|\text{data})} \\
&amp;= \frac{(P(\text{data}|H_1) \times P(H_1)) / P(\text{data}))}{(P(\text{data}|H_2) \times P(H_2)) / P(\text{data}))} \\
&amp;= \frac{(P(\text{data}|H_1) \times P(H_1))}{(P(\text{data}|H_2) \times P(H_2))} \\
&amp;= \boxed{\frac{P(\text{data}|H_1)}{P(\text{data}|H_2)}} \times \boxed{\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_2)}} \\
&amp;= \textbf{Bayes factor} \times \textbf{prior odds}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In mathematical notation, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[PO[H_1:H_2] = BF[H_1:H_2] \times O[H_1:H_2]\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, the posterior odds is the product of the Bayes factor and the prior odds for these two hypotheses.</p>
<p>The Bayes factor quantifies the evidence of data arising from <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In a discrete case, the Bayes factor is simply the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed data under the two hypotheses, written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[BF[H_1:H_2] = \frac{P(\text{data}|H_1)}{P(\text{data}|H_2)}.\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, in a continuous case, the Bayes factor is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods, written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[BF[H_1:H_2] = \frac{\int P(\text{data}|\theta,H_1)d\theta}{\int P(\text{data}|\theta,H_2)d\theta}.\]</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the set formed by all possible values of the model parameters.</p>
<p>In this section, we will stick with the simpler discrete case. And in upcoming sections, we will revisit calculating Bayes factors for more complicated models.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the HIV testing example from earlier, where our patient had tested positive in the ELISA.</p>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>: Patient does not have HIV</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>: Patient has HIV</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Priors</strong></p>
<p>The prior probabilities we place on these hypothesis came from the prevalence of HIV at the time in the general population. We were told that the prevalence of HIV in the population was 1.48 out of 1000, hence the prior probability assigned to <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> is 0.00148. And the prior assigned to <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is simply the complement of this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(H_1) = 0.99852\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(H_2) = 0.00148\)</span></p>
<p>The prior odds are</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(O[H_1:H_2] = \dfrac{P(H_1)}{P(H_2)} = \dfrac{0.99852}{0.00148} = 674.6757\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Posteriors</strong></p>
<p>Given a positive ELISA result, the posterior probabilities of these hypotheses can also be calculated, and these are approximately 0.88 and 0.12. We will hold on to more decimal places in our calculations to avoid rounding errors later.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(H_1|+) = 0.8788551\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(H_2|+) = 0.1211449\)</span></p>
<p>The posterior odds are</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(PO[H_1:H_2] = \dfrac{P(H_1|+)}{P(H_2|+)} = \dfrac{0.8788551}{0.1211449} = 7.254578\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Bayes Factor</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we can calculate the Bayes factor as the ratio of the posterior odds to prior odds, which comes out to approximately 0.0108. Note that in this simple discrete case the Bayes factor, it simplifies to the ratio of the likelihoods of the observed data under the two hypotheses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
BF[H_1:H_2] &amp;= \frac{PO[H_1:H_2]}{O[H_1:H_2]} = \frac{7.25457}{674.6757} \approx 0.0108 \\
&amp;= \frac{P(+|H_1)}{P(+|H_2)} = \frac{0.01}{0.93} \approx 0.0108
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, remember that the true positive rate of the test was 0.93 and the false positive rate was 0.01. Using these two values, the Bayes factor also comes out to approximately 0.0108.</p>
<p>So now that we calculated the Bayes factor, the next natural question is, what does this number mean? A commonly used scale for interpreting Bayes factors is proposed by <span class="citation">@jeffreys1961theory</span>, as in Table <a href="#tab:jeffreys1961">9</a>. If the Bayes factor is between 1 and 3, the evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> is not worth a bare mention. If it is 3 to 20, the evidence is positive.

<p>It might have caught your attention that the Bayes factor we calculated does not even appear on the scale. To obtain a Bayes factor value on the scale, we will need to change the order of our hypotheses and calculate <span class="math inline">\(BF[H_2:H_1]\)</span>, i.e. the Bayes factor for <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>. Then we look for evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> instead.</p>
<p>We can calculate <span class="math inline">\(BF[H_2:H_1]\)</span> as a reciprocal of <span class="math inline">\(BF[H_1:H_2]\)</span> as below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[BF[H_2:H_1] = \frac{1}{BF[H_1:H_2]} = \frac{1}{0.0108} = 92.59259\]</span></p>
<p>For our data, this comes out to approximately 93. Hence the evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> (the patient does not have HIV) is strong. Therefore, even though the posterior for having HIV given a positive result, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(P(H_2|+)\)</span>, was low, we would still decide that the patient has HIV, according to the scale based on a positive ELISA result.</p>
<p>An intuitive way of thinking about this is to consider not only the posteriors, but also the priors assigned to these hypotheses. Bayes factor is the ratio of the posterior odds to prior odds. While 12% is a low posterior probability for having HIV given a positive ELISA result, this value is still much higher than the overall prevalence of HIV in the population (in other words, the prior probability for that hypothesis).</p>
<p>Another commonly used scale for interpreting Bayes factors is proposed by <span class="citation">@kass1995bayes</span>, and it deals with the natural logarithm of the calculated Bayes factor. The values can be interpreted in Table <a href="#tab:kass1995">10</a>.</p>

<p>Reporting of the log scale can be helpful for numerical accuracy reasons when the likelihoods are very small. Taking two times the natural logarithm of the Bayes factor we calculated earlier, we would end up with the same decision that the evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> is strong.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2 \times \log(92.59259) = 9.056418\]</span></p>
<p>To recap, we defined prior odds, posterior odds, and the Bayes factor. We learned about scales by which we can interpret these values for model selection. We also re-emphasize that in Bayesian testing, the order in which we evaluate the models of hypotheses does <strong>not</strong> matter. The Bayes factor of <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(BF[H_2:H_1]\)</span>, is simply the reciprocal of the Bayes factor for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(BF[H_1:H_2]\)</span>.</p>

<h1>4 Inference and Decision-Making with Multiple Parameters</h1>
<p>We saw in <a href="#sec:normal-normal"><strong>??</strong></a> that if the data followed a normal distribution and that the variance was known, that the normal distribution was the conjugate prior distribution for the unknown mean. In this chapter, we will focus on the situation when the data follow a normal distribution with an unknown mean, but now consider the case where the variance is also unknown. When the variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> of the data is also unknown, we need to specify a joint prior distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(\mu, \sigma^2)\)</span> for both the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and the variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. We will introduce the conjugate normal-gamma family of distributions where the posterior distribution is in the same family as the prior distribution and leads to a marginal Student t distribution for posterior inference for the mean of the population.</p>
<p>We will present Monte Carlo simulation for inference about functions of the parameters as well as sampling from predictive distributions, which can also be used to assist with prior elicitation. For situations when limited prior information is available, we discuss a limiting case of the normal-gamma conjugate family, the reference prior, leading to a prior that can be used for a default or reference analysis. Finally, we will show how to create a more flexible and robust prior distribution by using mixtures of the normal-gamma conjugate prior, the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow prior. For inference in this case we will introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo, a powerful simulation method for Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the readers have mastered the concepts of one-parameter normal-normal conjugate priors. Calculus is not required for this section; however, for those who are comfortable with calculus and would like to go deeper, we shall present optional sections with more details on the derivations.</p>
<p>Also note that some of the examples in this section use an updated version of the <code>bayes_inference</code> function.

<p>You may take the safety of your drinking water for granted, however, residents of Flint, Michigan were outraged over reports that the levels of a contaminant known as <strong>TTHM</strong> exceeded federal allowance levels in 2014. TTHM stands for total trihalomethanes, a group of chemical compounds first identified in drinking water in the 1970’s. Trihalomethanes are formed as a by-product from the reaction of chlorine or bromine with organic matter present in the water being disinfected for drinking. THMs have been associated through epidemiological studies with some adverse health effects and many are considered carcinogenic. In the United States, the EPA limits the total concentration of the four chief constituents (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, and dibromochloromethane), referred to as total trihalomethanes (TTHM), to 80 parts per billion in treated water.</p>
<p>Since violations are based on annual running averages, we are interested in inference about the mean TTHM level based on measurements taken from samples.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="#sec:normal-normal"><strong>??</strong></a> we described the normal-normal conjugate family for inference about an unknown mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> when the data <span class="math inline">\(Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n\)</span> were assumed to be a random sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from a normal population with a known standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, however, it is more common in practice to have data where the variability of observations is unknown, as in the example with TTHM. Conceptually, Bayesian inference for two (or more) parameters is not any different from the case with one parameter. As both <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> unknown, we will need to specify a <strong>joint</strong> prior distribution, <span class="math inline">\(p(\mu, \sigma^2)\)</span> to describe our prior uncertainty about them. As before, Bayes Theorem leads to the posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> given the observed data to take the form
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
p(\mu, \sigma^2 \mid y_1, \ldots, y_n)  = 
\frac{p(y_1, \ldots, y_n \mid \mu, \sigma^2) \times
p(\mu, \sigma^2)}
{\text{normalizing constant}}. 
\end{equation}\]</span>
The <strong>likelihood function</strong> for <span class="math inline">\(\mu, \sigma^2\)</span> is proportional to the sampling distribution of the data, <span class="math inline">\({\cal L}(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto p(y_1, \ldots, y_n \mid \mu, \sigma^2)\)</span> so that the posterior distribution can be re-expressed in proportional form
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\mu, \sigma^2 \mid y_1, \ldots, y_n)  \propto {\cal L}(\mu, \sigma^2) p(\mu, \sigma^2).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>As in the earlier chapters, conjugate priors are appealing as there are nice expressions for updating the prior to obtain the posterior distribution using summaries of the data. In the case of two parameters or more parameters a conjugate pair is a sampling model for the data and a joint prior distribution for the unknown parameters such that the joint posterior distribution is in the same family of distributions as the prior distribution. In this case our sampling model is built on the assumption that the data are a random sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from a normal population with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, expressed in shorthand as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
Y_1, \ldots Y_n  \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}
\textsf{Normal}(\mu, \sigma^2) 
\end{aligned}\]</span>
where the ‘iid’ above the distribution symbol ‘<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>’ indicates that each of the observations are <strong>i</strong>ndependent of the others (given <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>) and are <strong>i</strong>dentically <strong>d</strong>istributed. Under this assumption, the sampling distribution of the data is the product of independent normal distributions with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(y_1, \ldots, y_n \mid \mu, \sigma^2) = \prod_{i = 1}^n
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}
e^{\left\{- \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{y_i - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right\}}
\end{equation}\]</span>
which, after some algebraic manipulation and simplification, leads to a
likelihood function for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> that is proportional to
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
{\cal L}(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto 
(\sigma^2)^{-n/2}  \times \exp{ \left\{   
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2 }{\sigma^2}
\right\}}  &amp; \times 
\exp{ \left\{   
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{n (\bar{y} - \mu)^2 }{\sigma^2} \right\}} \\
  \text{function of $\sigma^2$ and data} &amp; \times
  \text{function of $\mu$, $\sigma^2$ and data}
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
which depends on the data only through the sum of squares <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2\)</span> (or equivalently the sample variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2/(n-1)\)</span>) and the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>.
From the expression for the likelihood, we can see that the likelihood factors into two pieces: a term that is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> and the data; and a term that involves <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> and the data.</p>
<p>Based on the factorization in the likelihood and the fact that any joint distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> can be expressed as
<span class="math display">\[
p(\mu, \sigma^2) = p(\mu \mid \sigma^2) \times p(\sigma^2)
\]</span>
as the product of a <strong>conditional distribution</strong> for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> and a <strong>marginal distribution</strong> for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, this suggests that the posterior distribution should factor as the product of two conjugate distributions. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is indeed the case.</p>
<div id="conjugate-prior-for-mu-and-sigma2" class="section level3">
<h3>Conjugate Prior for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span></h3>
<p>In Section <a href="#sec:normal-normal"><strong>??</strong></a>, we found that for normal data, the conjugate prior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> when the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> was known was a normal distribution. We will build on this to specify a conditional prior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> as a normal distribution
<span class="math display" id="eq:04-conjugate-normal">\[\begin{equation}
\mu \mid \sigma^2   \sim  \textsf{N}(m_0, \sigma^2/n_0)
\tag{8}
\end{equation}\]</span>
with hyper-parameters <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>, the prior mean for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2/n_0\)</span> the prior variance. While previously we represented the prior variance as a fixed constant, <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>, in this case we will replace <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span> with a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Because <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> has the same units as the data, the presence of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in the prior variance automatically scales the prior for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> based on the same units. This is important, for example, if we were to change the measurement units from inches to centimeters or seconds to hours, as the prior will be re-scaled automatically. The hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> is unitless, but is used to express our prior precision about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> relative to the level of “noise”, captured by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, in the data. Larger values of <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> indicate that we know the mean with more precision (relative to the variability in observations) with smaller values indicating less precision or more uncertainty. We will see later how the hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> may be interpreted as a prior sample size. Finally, while we could use a fixed value <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span> as the prior variance in a conditional conjugate prior for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, that does not lead to a joint conjugate prior for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is unknown, a Bayesian would use a
prior distribution to describe the uncertainty about the variance before seeing data. Since the variance is non-negative, continuous, and with no upper limit, based on the distributions that we have seen so far a gamma distribution might appear to be a candidate prior for the variance,. However, that choice does not lead to a posterior distribution in the same family or that is recognizable as any common distribution. It turns out that the the inverse of the variance, which is known as the precision, has a conjugate gamma prior distribution.</p>
<p>For simplification let’s express the precision (inverse variance) as a new parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\phi = 1/\sigma^2\)</span>. Then the conjugate prior for <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>,
<span class="math display" id="eq:04-conjugate-gamma">\[\begin{equation}
\phi \sim \textsf{Gamma}\left(\frac{v_0}{2}, \frac{v_0 s^2_0}{2} \right)
\tag{9}
\end{equation}\]</span>
is a gamma distribution with shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(v_0/2\)</span> and <strong>rate</strong> parameter of <span class="math inline">\({v_0 s^2_0}/{2}\)</span>. Given the connections between the gamma distribution and the Chi-Squared distribution, the hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> may be interpreted as the prior degrees of freedom. The hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(s^2_0\)</span> may be interpreted as a prior variance or initial prior estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Equivalently, we may say that the inverse of the variance has a
<span class="math display">\[1/\sigma^2 \sim \textsf{Gamma}(v_0/2, s^2_0 v_0/2)\]</span></p>
<p>gamma distribution to avoid using a new symbol . Together the conditional normal distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> in <a href="#eq:04-conjugate-normal">(8)</a> and the marginal gamma distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> in <a href="#eq:04-conjugate-gamma">(9)</a> lead to a joint distribution for the pair <span class="math inline">\((\mu, \phi)\)</span> that we will call the normal-gamma family of distributions:
<span class="math display" id="eq:04-conjugate-normal-gamma">\[\begin{equation}(\mu, \phi) \sim \textsf{NormalGamma}(m_0, n_0, s^2_0, v_0)
\tag{10}
\end{equation}\]</span>
with the four hyper-parameters <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s^2_0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can obtain the density for the (<span class="math inline">\(m_0, n_0, \nu_0, s^2_0\)</span>) family of distributions for <span class="math inline">\(\mu, \phi\)</span> by multiplying the conditional normal distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> times the marginal gamma distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\mu, \phi) = \frac{(n_0 \phi)^{1/2}} {\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{- \frac{\phi n_0}{2} (\mu -m_0)^2} \frac{1}{\Gamma(\nu_0/2)} (\nu_0 s^2_0 )^{\nu_0/2 -1} e^{- \phi \frac{\nu_0 s^2_0} {2}}
\label{eq:NG}

<p>The joint conjugate prior has simple rules for updating the prior hyper-parameters given new data to obtain the posterior hyper-parameters due to conjugacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="conjugate-posterior-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Conjugate Posterior Distribution</h3>
<p>As a conjugate family, the posterior
distribution of the pair of parameters (<span class="math inline">\(\mu, \phi\)</span>) is in the same family as the prior distribution when the sample data arise from a normal distribution, that is the posterior is also normal-gamma
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
(\mu, \phi) \mid \text{data} \sim \textsf{NormalGamma}(m_n, n_n, s^2_n, v_n)
\end{equation}\]</span>
where the subscript <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> on the
hyper-parameters indicates the updated values after seeing the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations from the sample data. One attraction of conjugate families is there are relatively simple updating rules for obtaining the new hyper-parameters:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
m_n &amp; = &amp; \frac{n \bar{Y} + n_0 m_0} {n + n_0}  \\
&amp; \\
n_n &amp; = &amp; n_0 + n  \\
v_n &amp; = &amp; v_0 + n  \\
s^2_n &amp; =  &amp; \frac{1}{v_n}\left[ s^2 (n-1) + s^2_0 v_0 + \frac{n_0 n}{n_n} (\bar{y} - m_0)^2 \right]. 
\end{eqnarray*}\]</span>
Let’s look more closely to try to understand the updating rules.
The updated hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(m_n\)</span> is the posterior mean for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>; it is also the mode and median. The posterior mean <span class="math inline">\(m_n\)</span> is a weighted average of the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> and prior mean <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span> with weights <span class="math inline">\(n/(n + n_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_0/(n + n_0)\)</span> that are proportional to the precision in the data, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and the prior precision, <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>The posterior sample size <span class="math inline">\(n_n\)</span> is the sum of the prior sample
size <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> and the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, representing the combined precision after seeing the data for the posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The posterior degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span> are also increased by adding the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to the prior degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, the posterior variance hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(s^2_n\)</span> combines three sources of information about <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> in terms of sums of squared deviations. The first term in
the square brackets is the sample variance times the sample degrees of
freedom, <span class="math inline">\(s^2 (n-1) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2\)</span>, which is the sample sum of squares. Similarly, we may view the second term as a sum of squares based on prior data, where <span class="math inline">\(s^2_0\)</span> was an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. The squared difference of the sample mean and prior mean in the last term also provides an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, where a large value of <span class="math inline">\((\bar{y} - \mu_0)^2\)</span> increases the posterior sum of squares <span class="math inline">\(v_n s^2_n\)</span>.<br />
If the sample mean is far from our prior mean, this increases the probability that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is large. Adding these three sum of squares provides the posterior sum of square, and dividing by the posterior
posterior degrees of freedom we obtain the new hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(s^2_n\)</span>, which is an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> combining the sources of variation from the prior and the data.</p>
<p>The joint posterior distribution for the pair <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>
<span class="math display">\[(\mu, \phi) \mid \text{data} \sim \text{NormalGamma}(m_n, n_n, s^2_n, v_n)\]</span>
is in the normal-gamma family, and is equivalent to a <strong>hierarchical model</strong> specified in two stages: in the
first stage of the hierarchy the inverse variance or precision marginally has a gamma distribution,

<h3>Marginal Distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>: Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span></h3>
<p>The joint normal-gamma posterior summarizes our current knowledge about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, however, we are generally interested in inference about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> unconditionally
as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is unknown. This marginal inference requires the unconditional or marginal distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> that `averages’ over the uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. For continuous variables like <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, this averaging is performed by integration leading to a Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution.</p>
<p>The <em>standardized Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution</em> <span class="math inline">\(t_\nu\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> degrees of freedom is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[ p(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\nu}}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{\nu}{2})}\left(1 + \frac{t^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}} \]</span>
where the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(\cdot)\)</span> is the Gamma function defined earlier in Equation <a href="#eq:gamma-function">(7)</a>. The standard Student’s <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is centered at 0 (the location parameter), with a scale parameter equal to 1, like in a standard normal, however, there is an additional parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, the degrees of freedom parameter.</p>
<p>The Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution is similar to the normal distribution as it is symmetric about the center and bell shaped, however, the <strong>tails</strong> of the distribution are fatter or heavier than the normal distribution and therefore, it is a little “shorter” in the middle as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:density"><strong>??</strong></a></p>

<p>Similar to the normal distribution, we can obtain other Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distributions by changing the center of the distribution and changing the scale. A Student t distribution with a location <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and scale <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> degrees of freedom is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(t(v, m, s^2)\)</span>, with the standard Student t as a special case, <span class="math inline">\(t(\nu, 0, 1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The density for a <span class="math inline">\(X \sim t(v, m, s^2)\)</span> random variable is
<span class="math display" id="eq:Student-t-density">\[\begin{equation}
p(x) =\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{v + 1}{2} \right)}
{\sqrt{\pi v} s \,\Gamma\left(\frac{v}{2} \right)}
\left(1 + \frac{1}{v}\left(\frac{x - m} {s} \right)^2 \right)^{-\frac{v+1}{2}} 
\tag{11}
\end{equation}\]</span>
and by subtracting the location <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and dividing by the scale
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[ \frac{X - m}{s} \equiv t \sim t(v, 0 , 1)  \]</span>
we can obtain the distribution of the standardized Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, location <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and scale <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. This latter representation allows us to use standard statistical functions for posterior inference such as finding credible intervals.</p>
We are now ready for our main result for the marginal distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.

Since the Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is unimodal and symmetric, the shortest 95 percent credible interval or the <strong>Highest Posterior Density</strong> interval, HPD for short,

<p>Let’s try to understand the arguments to the function. The first argument of the function is the variable of interest, <code>tthm</code>, while the second argument is a dataframe with the variable. The argument <code>prior="NG"</code> indicates that we are using a normal-gamma prior; later we will present alternative priors. The next two lines provide our prior hyper-parameters. The line with <code>stat="mean", type="ci"</code> indicate that we are interested in inference about the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and to calculate a credible interval for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The argument <code>method = theoretical</code> indicates that we will use the exact quantiles of the Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution to obtain our posterior credible intervals. Looking at the output the credible interval agrees with the interval we calculated from the summaries using the t quantiles. The other arguments are logical variables to toggle on/off the various output. In this case we have suppressed producing the plot of the posterior distribution using the option <code>show_plot=FALSE</code>, however, setting this to <code>TRUE</code> produces the density and credible interval shown in Figure @ref{fig:tapwater-post-mu}.</p>
<p>How do we interpret these results? Based on the updated posterior, we find that there is a 95% chance that
the mean TTHM concentration is between 39.9
parts per billion and 51.8 parts per billion, suggesting that for this period that the municipality is in compliance with the limits.</p>

<h3>Section Summary</h3>
<p>The normal-gamma conjugate prior for
inference about an unknown mean and variance for samples from a normal
distribution allows simple expressions for updating prior beliefs given the data. The joint normal-gamma distribution leads to the
Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution for inference about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is unknown. The Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution can be used to provide
credible intervals for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> using <code>R</code> or other software that provides quantiles of a standard <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution.</p>
<p>For the energetic learner who is comfortable with calculus, the optional material at the end of this section provides more details on how the posterior distributions were obtained and other results in this section.</p>
<p>For those that are ready to move on, we will introduce Monte Carlo sampling in the next section; Monte Carlo sampling is a simulation method that will allow us to approximate distributions of transformations of the parameters without using calculus or change of variables, as well as assist exploratory data analysis of the prior or posterior distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="optional-derivations" class="section level3">
<h3>(Optional) Derivations</h3>
<p>From Bayes Theorem we have that the joint posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood of the parameters times the joint prior distribution
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\mu, \sigma^2 \mid y_1, \ldots, y_n)  \propto {\cal L}(\mu, \sigma^2) p(\mu, \sigma^2).
\end{equation}\]</span> where the
likelihood function for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is proportional to
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
{\cal L}(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto 
(\sigma^2)^{-n/2}  \times \exp{ \left\{   
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2 }{\sigma^2}
\right\}}  &amp; \times 
\exp{ \left\{   
-\frac{1}{2} \frac{n (\bar{y} - \mu)^2 }{\sigma^2} \right\}} \\
  \text{{function of $\sigma^2$ and data}} &amp; \times
  \text{{function of $\mu$, $\sigma^2$ and data}}
\end{align}
\]</span>
which depends on the data only through the sum of squares <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2\)</span> (or equivalently the sample variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2/(n-1)\)</span>) and the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>.
Since the likelihood function for <span class="math inline">\((\mu, \phi)\)</span> is obtained by just substituting <span class="math inline">\(1/\phi\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, the likelihood may be re-expressed as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
{\cal L}(\mu, \phi) \propto 
\phi^{n/2}  \times \exp{ \left\{   
-\frac{1}{2} \phi (n-1) s^2
\right\}}   \times 
\exp{ \left\{   
-\frac{1}{2} \phi n (\bar{y} - \mu)^2  \right\}}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This likelihood may be obtained also be obtained by using the sampling distribution for the summary statistics, where
<span class="math display">\[\bar{Y}  \mid \mu, \phi \sim \textsf{Normal}(\mu, 1/(\phi n))\]</span>
and is independent of the sample variance (conditional on <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>) and has a gamma distribution
<span class="math display">\[ 
s^2 \mid \phi \sim  \textsf{Gamma}\left(\frac{n - 1}{2},  \frac{(n-1) \phi}{2}\right)
\]</span>
with degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> and rate <span class="math inline">\((n-1) \phi/2\)</span>; the likelihood is the product of the two sampling distributions: <span class="math inline">\({\cal{L}}(\mu, \phi) \propto p(s^2 \mid \phi) p(\bar{Y} \mid \phi)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Bayes theorem in proportional form leads to the joint posterior distribution
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(\mu, \phi \mid \text{data})  \propto &amp; {\cal{L}}(\mu, \phi) p(\phi) p(\mu \mid \phi)  \\
 =  &amp; \phi^{(n-1)/2)} 
 \exp\left\{ - \frac{ \phi (n-1) s^2 }{2}\right\} 
 \text{  (sampling distribution for  $\phi$) }\\
&amp; \times  (n\phi)^{1/2}   \exp\left\{- \frac 1 2  n \phi (\bar{y} - \mu)^2 \right\} \text{  ( sampling distribution for $\mu$)}
\\
&amp; \times \phi^{\nu_0/2 -1} \exp\{- \frac{ \phi \nu_0 s^2_0}{2}\} \text{ (prior for  $\phi$)}
\\
&amp; \times 
(n_0\phi)^{1/2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 \pi)}} \exp\left\{- \frac 1 2  n_0 \phi (\mu - m_0)^2 \right\} \text{ (prior for $\mu$)}
\end{align}
\]</span>
where we have ignored constants that do not involve <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.
Focusing on all the terms that involve <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, we can group the lines corresponding to the sampling distribution and prior for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> together and using the factorization of likelihood and prior distributions, we may identify that
<span class="math display">\[p(\mu \mid \phi, \text{data})  \propto  \exp\left\{- \frac 1 2  n \phi (\bar{y} - \mu)^2  - \frac 1 2  n_0 \phi (\mu - m_0)^2 \right\} 
\]</span>
where the above expression includes the sum of two quadratic expressions in the exponential. This almost looks like a normal. Can these be combined to form one quadratic expression that looks like a normal density? Yes! This is known as “completing the square”.
Taking a normal distribution for a parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> with mean <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and precision <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, the quadratic term in the exponential may be expanded as
<span class="math display">\[\rho \times (\mu - m)^2 = \rho  \mu^2 - 2 \rho  \mu m + \rho  m^2.\]</span>
From this we can read off that the precision is the term that multiplies the quadratic in <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and the term that multiplies the linear term in <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the product of two times the mean and precision; this means that if we know the precision, we can identify the mean. The last term is the precision times the mean squared, which we will need to fill in once we identify the precision and mean.</p>
<p>For our posterior, we need to expand the quadratics and recombine
terms to identify the new precision (the coefficient multiplying the quadratic in <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) and the new mean (the linear term) and complete the square so that it may be factored. Any left over terms will be independent of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> but may depend on <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>. For our case, after some algebra to group terms we have
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
- \frac 1 2 \left( n \phi (\bar{y} - \mu)^2  +  n_0 \phi (\mu - m_0)^2 \right) \\
= -\frac 1 2 \left(\phi( n + n_0) \mu^2 - 2 \phi \mu (n \bar{y} + n_0 m_0) + \phi (n \bar{y}^2 + n_0 m_0^2) \right)  
\end{align}\]</span>
where we can read off that the posterior precision is <span class="math inline">\(\phi(n + n_0) \equiv \phi n_n\)</span>. The linear term is not yet of the form of the posterior precision times the posterior mean (times 2), but if we multiply and divide by <span class="math inline">\(n_n = n + n_0\)</span> it is in the appropriate form
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}-\frac 1 2 \left(\phi( n + n_0) \mu^2 - 2 \phi ( n + n_0) \mu \frac{(n \bar{y} + n_0 m_0) } {n + n_0} + \phi (n \bar{y}^2 + n_0 m_0^2) \right) \label{eq:quad}
 \end{equation}\]</span>
so that we may identify that the posterior mean is <span class="math inline">\(m_n = (n \bar{y} + n_0 m_0) /(n + n_0)\)</span> which combined with the precision (or inverse variance) is enough to identity the conditional posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.
We next add the precision times the square of the posterior mean (the completing the square part), but to keep equality, we will need to subtract the term as well:
<span class="math display">\[
- \frac 1 2 \left( n \phi (\bar{y} - \mu)^2  +  n_0 \phi (\mu - m_0)^2 \right)  \\
= -\frac 1 2 \left(\phi n_n \mu^2 - 2 \phi n_n \mu m_n + \phi n_n m_n^2  - \phi n_n m_n^2  + \phi (n \bar{y}^2 + n_0 m_0^2) \right)  
\]</span>
which after factoring the quadratic leads to
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
 - \frac 1 2 \left( n \phi (\bar{y} - \mu)^2  +  n_0 \phi (\mu - m_0)^2 \right) \\
 = -\frac 1 2 \left(\phi n_n (\mu - m_n)^2 \right) -\frac 1 2 \left(\phi (-n_n m_n^2 + n \bar{y}^2 + n_0 m_0^2) \right) 
\end{align}\]</span>
where the first line is the quadratic for the posterior of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> while the second line includes terms that involve <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> but that are independent of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>Substituting the expressions, we can continue to simplify the expressions further
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p(\mu, \phi \mid \text{data})  \propto &amp; {\cal{L}}(\mu, \phi) p(\phi) p(\mu \mid \phi)  \\

<p>To simplify notation, we’ll substitute <span class="math inline">\(\phi = 1/\sigma^2\)</span>.

<h2>Monte Carlo Inference</h2>
<p>In Section <a href="#sec:normal-gamma"><strong>??</strong></a>, we showed how to obtain the conditional posterior distribution for the mean of a normal population given the variance and the marginal posterior distribution of the precision (inverse variance). The marginal distribution of the mean, which “averaged over uncertainty” about the unknown variance could be obtained via integration, leading to the Student t distribution that was used for inference about the population mean. However, what if we are interested in the distribution of the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> itself, or other transformations of the parameters? There may not be a closed-form expression for the distributions or they may be difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>It turns out that <strong>Monte Carlo sampling</strong>, however, is an easy way to make an inference about parameters, when we cannot analytically calculate distributions of parameters, expectations, or probabilities. Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling from distributions for making inferences. The name refers to the famous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, home to games of chance such as roulette.</p>
<div id="monte-carlo-sampling" class="section level3">
<h3>Monte Carlo Sampling</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a case where we know the posterior distribution. As a quick recap, recall that the joint posterior distribution for the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and the precision <span class="math inline">\(\phi = 1/\sigma^2\)</span> under the conjugate prior for the Gaussian distribution is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional posterior distribution for the mean
<span class="math display">\[\mu \mid \text{data}, \sigma^2  \sim  \text{Normal}(m_n, \sigma^2/n_n)\]</span></li>
<li>Marginal posterior distribution for the precision <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> or inverse variance:
<span class="math display">\[1/\sigma^2 = \phi \mid \text{data}   \sim   \text{Gamma}(v_n/2,s^2_n v_n/2)\]</span></li>
<li>Marginal posterior distribution for the mean <span class="math display">\[\mu \mid \text{data} \sim t(v_n, m_n, s^2_n/n_n)\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For posterior inference about <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, we can generate <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> random samples from the Gamma posterior distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\phi^{(1)},\phi^{(2)},\cdots,\phi^{(S)} \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \text{Gamma}(v_n/2,s^2_n v_n/2)\]</span></p>
<p>Recall that the term <strong>iid</strong> stands for <strong>i</strong>ndependent and <strong>i</strong>dentically <strong>d</strong>istributed. In other words, the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> draws of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> are independent and identically distributed from the gamma distribution.</p>
<p>We can use the empirical distribution (histogram) from the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> samples to approximate the actual posterior distribution and the sample mean of the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> random draws of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> can be used to approximate the posterior mean of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>.
Likewise, we can calculate probabilities, quantiles and other functions using the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> samples from the posterior distribution. For example, if we want to calculate the posterior expectation of some function of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, written as <span class="math inline">\(g(\phi)\)</span>, we can approximate that by taking the average of the function, and evaluate it at the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> draws of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, written as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{S}\sum^S_{i=1}g(\phi^{(i)})\)</span>.</p>
<p>The approximation to the expectation of the function, <span class="math inline">\(E[g(\phi \mid \text{data})]\)</span> improves</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{S}\sum^S_{i=1}g(\phi^{(i)}) \rightarrow E[g(\phi \mid \text{data})]\]</span>
as the number of draws <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> in the Monte Carlo simulation increases.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>To recap, we have introduced the powerful method of Monte Carlo simulation for posterior inference. Monte Carlo methods provide estimates of expectations, probabilities, and quantiles of distributions from the simulated values. Monte Carlo simulation also allows us to approximate distributions of functions of the parameters, or the transformations of the parameters where it may be difficult to get exact theoretical values.</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss predictive distributions and show how Monte Carlo simulation may be used to help choose prior hyperparameters, using the prior predictive distribution of data and draw samples from the posterior predictive distribution for predicting future observations.

<p>By <em>averaging</em> over the possible values of the parameters from the prior distribution in the joint distribution, technically done by a double integral, we obtain the Student t as our prior predictive distribution. For those interested, details of this derivation are provided later in an optional section.
This distribution of the observables depends only on our four hyper-parameters from the normal-gamma family. We can use Monte Carlo simulation to sample from the prior predictive distribution to help elicit prior hyper-parameters as we now illustrate with the tap water example from earlier.</p>

<h3>Tap Water Example (continued)</h3>
<p>A report from the city water department suggests that levels of TTHM are expected to be between 10-60 parts per billion (ppb). Let’s see how we can use this information to create an informative conjugate prior.</p>
<p><strong>Prior Mean</strong>
First, the normal distribution and Student t distributions are symmetric around the mean or center parameter, so we will set the prior mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> to be at the midpoint of the interval 10-60, which would lead to <span class="math display">\[m_0 = (60+10)/2 = 35\]</span>
as our prior hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Prior Variance</strong>
Based on the empirical rule for bell-shaped distributions, we would expect that 95% of observations are within plus or minus two standard deviations from the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\pm 2\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Using this we expect that the range of the data should be approximately <span class="math inline">\(4\sigma\)</span>. Using the values from the report, we can use this to find our prior estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_0 = (60-10)/4 = 12.5\)</span> or
<span class="math display">\[s_0^2 = [(60-10)/4]^2 = 156.25\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Prior Sample Size and Degrees of Freedom</strong>
To complete the specification, we also need to choose the prior sample size <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> and degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>. For a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the sample variance has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> degrees of freedom. Thinking about a possible historic set of data of size <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> that led to the reported interval, we will adopt that rule to obtain the prior degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(v_0 = n_0 - 1\)</span>, leaving only the prior sample size to be determined. We will draw samples from the prior predictive distribution and modify <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> so that the simulated data agree with our prior assumptions.</p>

<h3>Sampling from the Prior Predictive in <code>R</code></h3>
<p>The following <code>R</code> code shows a simulation from the predictive distribution with the prior sample size <span class="math inline">\(n_0 = 2\)</span>. Please be careful to not confuse the prior sample size, <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span>, that represents the precision of our prior information with the number of Monte Carlo simulations, <span class="math inline">\(S = 10000\)</span>, that are drawn from the distributions. These Monte Carlo samples are used to estimate quantiles of the prior predictive distribution and a large value of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> reduces error in the Monte Carlo approximation.</p>

<p>Let’s try to understand the code. After setting the prior hyper-parameters and random seed, we begin by simulating <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> from its gamma prior distribution. We then transform <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Using the draws of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, we feed that into the <code>rnorm</code> function to simulate <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> values of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> for each value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The Monte Carlo draws of <span class="math inline">\(\mu,\sigma\)</span> are used to generate <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> possible values of TTHM denoted by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In the above code we are exploiting that all of the functions for simulating from distributions can be vectorized, i.e. we can provide all <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> draws of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to the functions and get a vector result back without having to write a loop. Finally, we obtain the empirical quantiles from our Monte Carlo sample using the <code>quantile</code> function to approximate the actual quantiles from the prior predictive distriubtion.</p>
<p>This forward simulation propagates uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to the prior predictive distribution of the data. Calculating the sample quantiles from the samples of the prior predictive for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we see that the 95% predictive interval for TTHM includes negative values. Since TTHM cannot be negative, we can adjust <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> and repeat. Since we need a narrower interval in order to exclude zero, we can increase <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> until we achieve the desired quantiles.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, we find that the prior sample size of 25, the empirical quantiles from the prior predictive distribution are close to the range of 10 to 60 that we were given as prior information.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>By using Monte Carlo methods, we can obtain prior and posterior predictive distributions of the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sampling from the prior predictive distribution can help with the selection of prior hyper parameters and verify that these choices reflect the prior information that is available.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualizing prior predictive distributions based on Monte Carlo simulations can help explore implications of our prior assumptions such as the choice of the hyper parameters or even assume distributions.</p></li>
<li><p>If samples are incompatible with known information, such as support on positive values, we may need to modify assumptions and look at other families of prior distributions.
## Reference Priors {#sec:NG-reference}</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Section <a href="#sec:NG-predictive"><strong>??</strong></a>, we demonstrated how to specify an informative prior distribution for inference about TTHM in tapwater using additional prior information. The resulting informative Normal-Gamma prior distribution had an effective prior sample size that was comparable to the observed sample size to be compatible with the reported prior interval.</p>
<p>There are, however, situations where you may wish to provide an analysis that does not depend on prior information. There may be cases where prior information is simply not available. Or, you may wish to present an <strong>objective</strong> analysis where minimal prior information is used to provide a baseline or reference analysis to contrast with other analyses based on informative prior distributions. Or perhaps, you want to use the Bayesian paradigm to make probability statements about parameters, but not use any prior information. In this section, we will examine the qustion of <strong>Can you actually perform a Bayesian analysis without using prior information?</strong>
We will present reference priors for normal data, which can be viewed as a limiting form of the Normal-Gamma conjugate prior distribution.</p>
<p>Conjugate priors can be interpreted to be based on a historical or imaginary prior sample. What happens in the conjugate Normal-Gamma prior if we take our prior sample size <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> to go to zero? If we have no data, then we will define the prior sample variance <span class="math inline">\(s_0^2\)</span> to go to 0, and based on the relationship between prior sample sized and prior degrees of freedom, we will let the prior degrees of freedom go to the prior sample size minus one, or negative one, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(v_0 = n_0 - 1 \rightarrow -1\)</span>.</p>
<p>With this limit, we have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The posterior mean goes to the sample mean.</p></li>
<li><p>The posterior sample size is the observed sample size.</p></li>
<li><p>The posterior degrees of freedom go to the sample degrees of freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>The posterior variance parameter goes to the sample variance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this limit, the posterior hyperparameters do not depend on the prior hyperparameters.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(n_0 \rightarrow 0, s^2_0 \rightarrow 0, v_0 = n_0 - 1 \rightarrow -1\)</span>, we have in mathematical terms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
m_n &amp;= \frac{n \bar{Y} + n_0 m_0} {n + n_0}  \rightarrow \bar{Y} \\
n_n &amp;= n_0 + n  \rightarrow n \\
v_n &amp;= v_0 + n  \rightarrow n-1 \\
s^2_n &amp;= \frac{1}{v_n}\left[s^2_0 v_0 + s^2 (n-1) + \frac{n_0 n}{n_n} (\bar{Y} - m_0)^2 \right] \rightarrow s^2
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>This limiting normal-gamma distribution, <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{NormalGamma}(0,0,0,-1)\)</span>, is not really a normal-gamma distribution, as the density does not integrate to 1. The form of the limit can be viewed as a prior for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> that is proportional to a constant, or uniform/flat on the whole real line. And a prior for the variance is proportional to 1 over the variance. The joint prior is taken as the product of the two.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
p(\mu \mid \sigma^2) &amp; \propto  1 \\
p(\sigma^2) &amp; \propto  1/\sigma^2 \\
p(\mu, \sigma^2) &amp; \propto  1/\sigma^2
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>This is refered to as a <strong>reference prior</strong> because the posterior hyperparameters do not depend on the prior hyperparameters.</p>
<p>In addition, <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{NormalGamma}(0,0,0,-1)\)</span> is a special case of a reference prior, known as the independent Jeffreys prior. While Jeffreys used other arguments to arrive at the form of the prior, the goal was to have an <strong>objective prior</strong> invariant to shifting the data by a constant or multiplying by a constant.</p>
<p>Now, a naive approach to constructing a non-informative distribution might be to use a uniform distribution to represent lack of knowledge. However, would you use a uniform distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, or a uniform distribution for the precision <span class="math inline">\(1/\sigma^2\)</span>? Or perhaps a uniform distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>? These would all lead to different posteriors with little justification for any of them. This ambiguity led Sir Harold Jeffreys to propose reference distributions for the mean and variance for situations where prior information was limited. These priors are <strong>invariant</strong> to the units of the data.</p>
<p>The unnormalized priors that do not integrate to a constant are called <strong>improper distributions</strong>. An important consideration in using them is that one cannot generate samples from the prior or the prior predictive distribution to data and are referred to as <strong>non-generative distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>While the reference prior is not a proper prior distribution, and cannot reflect anyone’s actual prior beliefs, the formal application phase rule can still be used to show that <strong>the posterior distribution is a valid normal gamma distribution</strong>, leading to a formal phase posterior distribution. That depends only on summary statistics of the data.</p>
<p>The posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{NormalGamma}(\bar{Y}, n, s^2, n-1)\)</span> breaks down to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mu \mid \sigma^2, \text{data} &amp; \sim \text{Normal}(\bar{Y}, \sigma^2/n) \\
1/\sigma^2  \mid \text{data} &amp; \sim \text{Gamma}((n-1)/2, s^2(n - 1)/2).
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the reference prior <span class="math inline">\(p(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto 1/\sigma^2\)</span>, the posterior distribution after standardizing <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> has a Student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> degrees of freedom.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\mu - \bar{Y}}{\sqrt{s^2/n}} \mid \text{data} \sim  t(n-1, 0, 1)\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to seeing the data, the distribution of the standardized sample mean given <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> also has a Student t distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\mu - \bar{Y}}{\sqrt{s^2/n}} \mid \mu, \sigma^2 \sim  t(n-1, 0, 1) \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Both frequentist sampling distributions and Bayesian reference posterior distributions lead to intervals of this form:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\bar{Y} - t_{1 - \alpha/2}\times s/\sqrt{n}, \, \bar{Y} + t_{1 - \alpha/2} \times s/\sqrt{n})\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>However, only the Bayesian approach justifies the probability statements about <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> being in the interval after seeing the data.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\bar{Y} - t_{1 - \alpha/2}\times s/\sqrt{n} &lt; \mu &lt;  \bar{Y} + t_{1 - \alpha/2}\times s/\sqrt{n}) = 1 - \alpha\]</span></p>
<p>We can use either analytic expressions based on the t-distribution, or Monte Carlo samples from the posterior predictive distribution, to make predictions about a new sample.</p>
<p>Here is some code to generate the Monte Carlo samples from the tap water example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>phi = rgamma(10000, (n-1)/2, s2*(n-1)/2)

<p>In constructing the informative prior from the reported interval, there are two critical assumptions. First, the prior data are exchangeable with the observed data. Second, the conjugate normal gamma distribution is suitable for representing the prior information. These assumptions may or may not be verifiable, but they should be considered carefully when using informative conjugate priors.</p>
<p>In the case of the tap water example, there are several concerns: One, it is unclear that the prior data are exchangeable with the observed data. For example, water treatment conditions may have changed. Two, the prior sample size was not based on a real prior sample, but instead selected so that the prior predictive intervals under the normal gamma model agreed with the prior data. As we do not have access to the prior data, we cannot check assumptions about normality that would help justify the prior. Other skewed distributions may be consistent with the prior interval, but lead to different conclusions.</p>
<p>To recap, we have introduced a reference prior for inference for
normal data with an unknown mean and variance. Reference priors are often part of a prior sensitivity study and are used when objectivity is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>If conclusions are fundamentally different with an informative prior and a reference prior, one may wish to carefully examine assumputions that led to the informative prior.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the prior information based on a prior sample that is exchangable with the observed data?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the normal-gamma assumption appropriate?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Informative priors can provide more accurate inference when data are limited, and the transparency of explicitly laying out prior assumptions is an important aspect of reproducible research. However, one needs to be careful that certain prior assumptions may lead to un-intended consequences.</p>
<p>Next, we will investigate a prior distribution that is a mixture of
conjugate priors, so the new prior distribution provides robustness to prior mis-specification in the prior sample size.</p>
<p>While we will no longer have nice analytical expressions for the posterior, we can simulate from the posterior distribution using a Monte Carlo algorithm
called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
## Mixtures of Conjugate Priors {#sec:NG-Cauchy}</p>
<p>In this section, we will describe priors that are constructed as a mixture of conjugate priors – in particular, the Cauchy distribution. As these are no longer conjugate priors, nice analytic expressions for the posterior distribution are not available. However, we can use a Monte Carlo algorithm called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for posterior inference.</p>
<p>In many situations, we may have reasonable prior information about the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, but we are less confident in how many observations our prior beliefs are equivalent to. We can address this uncertainty in the prior sample size, through an additional prior distribution on a <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> via a hierarchical prior.</p>
<p>The hierarchical prior for the normal gamma distribution is written as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mu \mid \sigma^2, n_0 &amp; \sim \text{Normal}(m_0, \sigma^2/n_0) \\
n_0 \mid \sigma^2 &amp;  \sim \text{Gamma}(1/2, r^2/2)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(r=1\)</span>, then this corresponds to a prior expected sample size of one because the expectation of <span class="math inline">\(\text{Gamma}(1/2,1/2)\)</span> is one.</p>
<p>The marginal prior distribution from <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> can be attained via integration, and we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu \mid \sigma^2  \sim  \Ca(m_0, \sigma^2 r^2)\]</span></p>
<p>This is a <strong>Cauchy distribution</strong> centered at the prior mean <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>, with the scale parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 r^2\)</span>. The probability density function (pdf) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(\mu \mid \sigma) = \frac{1}{\pi \sigma r} \left( 1 +  \frac{(\mu - m_0)^2} {\sigma^2 r^2}  \right)^{-1}\]</span></p>
<p>The Cauchy distribution does not have a mean or standard deviation, but the center (location) and the scale play a similar role to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution. The Cauchy distribution is a special case of a student <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with one degree of freedom.</p>
<p>As Figure <a href="#fig:cauchy-plot">21</a> shows, the standard Cauchy distribution with <span class="math inline">\(r=1\)</span> and the standard normal distribution <span class="math inline">\(\text{Normal}(0,1)\)</span> are centered at the same location. But the Cauchy distribution has heavier tails – more probability on extreme values than the normal distribution with the same scale parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Cauchy priors were recommended by Sir Harold Jeffreys as a default objective prior for testing.</p>

<p>The Cauchy prior described in Section <a href="#sec:NG-Cauchy"><strong>??</strong></a> is not a conjugate prior, and therefore, the posterior distribution from <span class="math inline">\((\mu \mid \sigma^2)\)</span>, is not a Cauchy or any well-known distribution. Fortunately, the conditional distribution of <span class="math inline">\((\mu, \sigma^2 \mid n_0, \text{data})\)</span>, is normal-gamma and easy to simulate from, as we learned in the previous sections. The conditional distribution of <span class="math inline">\((n_0 \mid \mu, \sigma^2, \text{data}\)</span>) is a gamma distribution, also easy to simulate from the given <span class="math inline">\(\mu, \sigma^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>It turns out that if we alternate generating Monte Carlo samples from these conditional distributions, the sequence of samples converges to samples from the joint distribution of <span class="math inline">\((\mu, \sigma^2, n_0)\)</span>, as the number of simulated values increases. The Monte Carlo algorithm we have just described is a special case of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), known as the Gibbs sampler.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the pseudo code for the algorithm.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># initialize MCMC
sigma2[1] = 1; n_0[1]=1; mu[1]=m_0

#draw from full conditional distributions
for (i in 2:S) {
  mu[i]     = p_mu(sigma2[i-1], n_0[i-1],  m_0, r, data)
  sigma2[i] = p_sigma2(mu[i], n_0[i-1],    m_0, r, data)
  n_0[i]    = p_n_0(mu[i], sigma2[i],      m_0, r, data)
}</code></pre>
<p>We start with the initial values of each of the parameters for <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span>. In theory, these can be completely arbitrary, as long as they are allowed values for the parameters.</p>
<p>For each iteration <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the algorithm will cycle through generating each parameter, given the <strong>current</strong> value of the other parameters. The functions , , and  return a simulated value from the respective distribution conditional on the inputs.</p>
<p>Whenever we update a parameter, we use the <strong>new value</strong> in the subsequent steps as the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> draws for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma, n_0\)</span>. We will repeat this until we reach iteration <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, leading to a dependent sequence of s draws from the joint posterior distribution.</p>
<p>Incorporating the tap water example in Section <a href="#sec:normal-gamma"><strong>??</strong></a>, we will use MCMC to generate samples under the Cauchy prior. We set 35 as the location parameter and <span class="math inline">\(r=1\)</span>. To complete our prior specification, we use the Jeffrey’s reference prior on <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. This combination is referred to as the Jeffrey’s Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior or “JZS” in the BayesFactor branch of the R  package.</p>

<p>Using the  function from the  package, we can obtain summary statistics and a plot from the MCMC output – not only <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, but also inference about <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> and the prior sample size.</p>
<p>The posterior mean under the JZS model is much closer to the sample mean than what the normal gamma prior used previously. Under the informative normal gamma prior, the sample made a 55.5, about eight standard deviations above the mean – a surprising value under the normal prior. Under the Cauchy prior, the informative prior location has much less influence.</p>
<p>This is <strong>the robustness property of the Cauchy prior</strong>, leading the posterior to put more weight on the sample mean than the prior mean, especially when the prior location is not close to the sample mean. We can see that the central 50% interval for <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> is well below the value 25 used in the normal prior, which placed almost equal weight on the prior in sample mean.</p>
<p>Using the MCMC draws of <span class="math inline">\(\mu, \sigma\)</span>, we can obtain Monte Carlo samples from the predictive distribution of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, by plugging <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> into the corresponding functions. Figure <a href="#fig:hist-ref-pred">22</a> compares the posterior densities estimated from the simulative values of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and the predicted draws of TTHM under the Jeffrey Zellner-Siow prior, and the informative normal prior from <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n_0 = 25\)</span> and the reference prior on <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>

<p>To recap, we have shown how to create more flexible prior distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution using mixtures of conjugate priors. As the posterior distributions are not available in closed form, we demonstrated how MCMC can be used for inference using the hierarchical prior distribution. Starting in the late 1980’s, MCMC algorithms have led to an exponential rise in the use of Bayes in methods, because complex models built through hierarchical distributions suddenly were tractable. The Cauchy prior is well-known for being robust prior mis-specifications. For example, having a prior mean that is far from the observed mean. This provides an alternative to the reference prior as a default or objective distribution that is proper.</p>
<p>In the next sections, we will return to Bayes factors and hypothesis testing where the Cauchy prior plays an important role.</p>
