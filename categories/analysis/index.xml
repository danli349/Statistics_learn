      <description>If \(f\) be defined on \([a,b]\) and for \(x\in[a,b]\) the limit \[f&amp;#39;(x)=\underset{t\to x}{\lim}\frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}\] exists, we say that \(f\) is differentiable at \(x\). If \(f&amp;#39;\) is defined at every point of a set \(E\subset[a,b]\), we say that \(f\) is differentiable on \(E\).
L’Hospital’s rule: Suppose \(f\) and \(g\) are real and differentiable in \((a, b)\) and \(g&amp;#39;(x)\ne 0\) for all \(x\in (a,b)\) where \(-\infty\le a&amp;lt;b\le+\infty\). Suppose \(\displaystyle\frac{f&amp;#39;(x)}{g&amp;#39;(x)}\to A\) as \(x\to a\).</description>

      <description>If a set \(E\) in \(R^k\) is closed and bounded, then \(E\subset I\) for some compact k-cell \(I\), then \(E\) is the closed subset of compact set \(I\) and \(E\) is also compact. A bounded infinite set \(E\) in \(R^k\) is a subset of a compact k-cell \(I\), and \(E\) must have a limit point in \(I\) or \(R^k\). E is compact implies every infinite subset \(K\) of E has a limit point in E, and which implies E is closed and bounded.</description>

      <description>A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) is said to converge if there is a point \(p\in X\) with the following property: For every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n\ge N\) implies that \(d(p_n,p)&amp;lt;\epsilon\) and we also say \(\{p_n\}\) converges to \(p\) or \(p\) is the limit of \(\{p_n\}\) and we write \[\lim_{x\to \infty}p_n=p\] or \(p_n\to p\). A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\), there is an integer \(N\) such that \(d(p_n,p_m)&amp;lt;\epsilon\) if \(n\ge N\) and \(m\ge N\).</description>

      <description>In metric space, a neighborhood of \(p\) is a set \(N_r(p)\) consisting of all \(q\) such that \(d(p,q)&amp;lt;r\), for some \(r&amp;gt;0\). The \(r\) is called radius of \(N_r(p)\). A point \(p\) is called a limit point of the set \(E\), if every neighborhood of \(p\) contains a point \(q\ne p\) and \(q\in E\). \(E\) is called closed if every limit point of \(E\) is a point of \(E\).</description>
