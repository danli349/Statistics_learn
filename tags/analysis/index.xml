      <description>The power series are \[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n\] The numbers \(c_n\) are called coefficients. \[R=\frac{1}{\displaystyle\lim_{n\to \infty}\text{sup}\sqrt[n]{|c_n|}}\] is called the radius of convergence of power series \[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n\] \[\displaystyle\lim_{n\to \infty}\text{sup}\sqrt[n]{|c_nx^n|}=\frac{|x|}{R}\] Then \[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n\] converges if \(|x|&amp;lt;R\) and diverges if \(|x|&amp;gt;R\).
Suppose the series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n\) converges for \(|x|&amp;lt;R\), then it converges uniformly on \([-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon], \varepsilon&amp;gt;0\). For \(|x|\leq R-\varepsilon\) we have \[|c_nx^n|\leq|c_n(R-\varepsilon)^n|\] and since \[\sum c_n(R-\varepsilon)^n\] converges absolutely (every power series converges absolutely in the interior of its radius), then there is an integer \(N\) that \[|\sum_{i=0}^{n}c_ix^i-\sum_{i=0}^{m}c_ix^i|=|\sum_{m+1}^{n}c_ix^i|&amp;lt;\varepsilon,\quad n\ge m\ge N\] then \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n\) converges uniformly.</description>

      <description>A sequence of functions \(\{f_n\}, n=1,2,3,\cdots,\) defined on \(E\), and suppose the sequence of numbers \(\{f_n(x)\}\) converges for every \(x\in E\), we define the function \(f\) by \[f(x)=\lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x)\quad (x\in E)\] We say that \(\{f_n\}\) converges to \(f\) pointwise on \(E\) and \(f\) is the limit function.
A sequence of functions \(\{f_n\}, n=1,2,3,\cdots,\) converges uniformly on \(E\) to a function \(f\) if for every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n&amp;gt;N\) implies \[|f_n(x)-f(x)|\le\epsilon\] for all \(x\in E\).</description>

      <description>If \(f\) be defined on \([a,b]\) and for \(x\in[a,b]\) the limit \[f&amp;#39;(x)=\underset{t\to x}{\lim}\frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}\] exists, we say that \(f\) is differentiable at \(x\). If \(f&amp;#39;\) is defined at every point of a set \(E\subset[a,b]\), we say that \(f\) is differentiable on \(E\).
The mean value theorem If \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous real functions on \([a,b]\) which are differentiable in \((a,b)\), then there is a point \(x\in(a,b)\) at which \[\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}=\frac{f&amp;#39;(x)}{g&amp;#39;(x)}\] Put \(h(t)=[f(b)-f(a)]g(t)-[g(b)-g(a)]f(t)\quad(a\le t\le b)\) then \(h\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and differentiable in \((a,b)\), and \(h(a)=[f(b)-f(a)]g(a)-[g(b)-g(a)]f(a)=f(b)g(a)-g(b)f(a)=h(b)\) To prove this theorem, we have to show that \(h&amp;#39;(x)=0\) for some \(x\in(a,b)\).</description>

      <description>A partition P of interval \([a,b]\) is a finite set of points \(x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_n\), where \(a=x_0\le x_1\le \cdots\le x_n=b\) and \(\Delta x_i=x_i-x_{i-1}\quad(i=1,\cdots,n)\). Let \[M_i=\text{sup }f(x)\quad(x_{i-1}\le x\le x_i)\] \[m_i=\text{inf }f(x)\quad(x_{i-1}\le x\le x_i)\] Corresponding to each partition \(P\) of \([a,b]\). We put \[U(P,f)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i\Delta x_i\] \[L(P,f)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i\Delta x_i\] \[\overline{\int}_{a}^{b} f dx=\text{inf}\sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i\Delta x_i\] \[\underline{\int}_{a}^{b} f dx=\text{sup}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i\Delta x_i\]which are called upper and lower Riemann integrals of \(f\) over \([a,b]\), respectively. If the upper and lower integrals are equal \[\overline{\int}_{a}^{b} f dx=\underline{\int}_{a}^{b} f dx\] we say that \(f\) is Riemann-integrable on \([a,b]\), we write \(f\in\mathscr R\).</description>

      <description>If a set \(E\) in \(R^k\) is closed and bounded, then \(E\subset I\) for some compact k-cell \(I\), then \(E\) is the closed subset of compact set \(I\) and \(E\) is also compact. A bounded infinite set \(E\) in \(R^k\) is a subset of a compact k-cell \(I\), and \(E\) must have a limit point in \(I\) or \(R^k\). E is compact implies every infinite subset \(K\) of E has a limit point in E, and which implies E is closed and bounded.</description>

      <description>A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) is said to converge if there is a point \(p\in X\) with the following property: For every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n\ge N\) implies that \(d(p_n,p)&amp;lt;\epsilon\) and we also say \(\{p_n\}\) converges to \(p\) or \(p\) is the limit of \(\{p_n\}\) and we write \[\lim_{x\to \infty}p_n=p\] or \(p_n\to p\). A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\), there is an integer \(N\) such that \(d(p_n,p_m)&amp;lt;\epsilon\) if \(n\ge N\) and \(m\ge N\).</description>

      <description>In metric space, a neighborhood of \(p\) is a set \(N_r(p)\) consisting of all \(q\) such that \(d(p,q)&amp;lt;r\), for some \(r&amp;gt;0\). The \(r\) is called radius of \(N_r(p)\). A point \(p\) is called a limit point of the set \(E\), if every neighborhood of \(p\) contains a point \(q\ne p\) and \(q\in E\). \(E\) is called closed if every limit point of \(E\) is a point of \(E\).</description>
