      <description>A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) is said to converge if there is a point \(p\in X\) with the following property: For every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n\ge N\) implies that \(d(p_n,p)&amp;lt;\epsilon\) and we also say \(\{p_n\}\) converges to \(p\) or \(p\) is the limit of \(\{p_n\}\) and we write \[\lim_{x\to \infty}p_n=p\] or \(p_n\to p\). A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for every \(\epsilon&amp;gt;0\), there is an integer \(N\) such that \(d(p_n,p_m)&amp;lt;\epsilon\) if \(n\ge N\) and \(m\ge N\).</description>

      <description>In metric space, a neighborhood of \(p\) is a set \(N_r(p)\) consisting of all \(q\) such that \(d(p,q)&amp;lt;r\), for some \(r&amp;gt;0\). The \(r\) is called radius of \(N_r(p)\). A point \(p\) is called a limit point of the set \(E\), if every neighborhood of \(p\) contains a point \(q\ne p\) and \(q\in E\). \(E\) is called closed if every limit point of \(E\) is a point of \(E\).</description>
